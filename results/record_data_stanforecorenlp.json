        "content": "Top 2 catalysts for Bitcoin, altcoin prices next week\nBitcoin and top altcoin prices suffered a harsh reversal toward the end of the week as the crypto fear and greed index remained in the fear zone.\nAfter soaring to $89,000, Bitcoin ( BTC ) crashed to about $82,000 on Saturday morning. See below.\nMeanwhile, the market cap of all digital coins fell to $2.73 trillion. This article highlights two potential catalysts for Bitcoin and other altcoins next week.\nTrump’s reciprocal tariffs\nNext week, President Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day,” on which he will impose reciprocal tariffs on the top U.S. trading partners, is expected to be the main catalyst for many cryptocurrencies and stocks .\nThe reciprocal tariffs aim to challenge what Trump views as unfair levies on US goods and non-tariff barriers\nThe European Union is reportedly considering concessions, while China plans countermeasures.\nEconomists caution that these tariffs will hurt American manufacturers by raising their costs and affecting their overseas business. As consumer spending and business investments drop, some experts argue that the U.S. faces an elevated risk of a recession.\nIn the March Ag Economists’ Monthly Monitor , for example, 62% of economists say the U.S. general economy will see a recession in 2025.\nTherefore, on Tuesday, expect Bitcoin and altcoin prices to react to these tariffs. In theory, these assets will likely continue falling when Trump unveils his tariffs.\nOn the other hand, these assets may bounce back since market participants have already priced in the tariffs. They may also rebound should certain countries make deals with the U.S.\nUS nonfarm payrolls data\nThe other key catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoin prices will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data from the US.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the data to show that the economy created 128,000 jobs in March. That’s a big drop from the 151,000 it created a month earlier. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.2%.\nHistorically, crypto and stock prices have reacted to job numbers because of their impact on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is tasked with maintaining stable inflation and low unemployment rates.\nThese numbers come as Wall Street is divided on what to expect from the Fed this year. Some analysts expect it will maintain rates steady this year because of the stubbornly high inflation, while others see it cutting later this year as Trump’s tariffs trigger a recession.",

Read More\nBitcoin has slipped to $82,516.97, down 1.55% in 24 hours, triggering concerns of a deeper correction. But according to Samson Mow , this breakdown is a “bear trap”—a fakeout designed to flush out weak hands before a larger move higher.\nMow remains firm on his $1 million BTC target, arguing the recent sell-off doesn’t reflect fundamentals. Bitcoin still holds a $1.64 trillion market cap, with 19.84 million BTC in circulation.\nWhile Mow sees upside ahead, charts tell a different story. BTC has broken below a symmetrical triangle, with the former support at $83,650 now acting as resistance.\nBitcoin Technical Setup Signals Caution\nThe recent breakdown from the symmetrical triangle pattern has turned $83,650 into a key resistance zone, stalling any immediate rebound. A bearish engulfing candle under this level signals continued selling pressure.\nCurrent Price : $82,516.97\n-\n24H Volume : $19.93B\n-\nResistance Levels : $83,650, $85,231, $86,841\n-\nSupport Levels : $82,000, $81,278, $79,990\n-\n50 EMA : $85,231 (above current price)\n-\nRSI (14) : 27.63 (oversold)\n-\nThe RSI remains oversold, but without bullish divergence, offering no clear sign of reversal. A breakdown through the triple bottom around $83,000 further weakens the structure, placing $81,278 and $79,990 in view. Volume near current levels is also subdued, reflecting a lack of strong buyer support.\nWhat Comes Next for Bitcoin?\nThe key question is whether this is the trap Mow describes, or the start of a broader correction. Broader sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic pressure and tight liquidity weighing on high-risk assets.\nA confirmed reclaim of $83,650, followed by a breakout above the 50 EMA at $85,231, would be an early signal of bullish recovery. Otherwise, continued failure at current levels risks a slide below $80,000.\nKey Signals to Monitor:\nBreak and close above $83,650\n-\nRSI divergence or recovery above 30\n-\nTrading volume increase on bounce attempts\n-\nSupport holding at $81,278 or $79,990\n-\nUntil these conditions are met, Bitcoin remains vulnerable. Whether Samson Mow’s call plays out will depend on how markets respond in the days ahead.\nBTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale\nBTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities.\nStaking & Passive Income Opportunities\nBTC Bull offers a high-yield staking program with an impressive 119% APY, allowing users to generate passive income. The staking pool has already attracted 882.5 million BTCBULL tokens, highlighting strong community participation.\nLatest Presale Updates:\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.002425 per BTCBULL\n-\nTotal Raised: $4M / $4.5M target\n-\nWith demand surging, this presale provides an opportunity to acquire BTCBULL at early-stage pricing before the next price increase.",

        "content": "Overlooked crypto trends that could define 2025 | Opinion\nDisclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial.\nAs we approach the end of Q1 2025, this year hasn’t exactly panned out as many thought it would in the digital assets space. However, if crypto is consistently one thing, it’s unpredictable.\nWhile the market is down, largely due to global economics outside its control, industry optimism remains high, and there are plenty of reasons to support this sentiment. From the high possibility of a pro-crypto regulatory framework in the United States and the continued expansion of DeFi to strategic cryptocurrency reserves and more AI, the industry is maturing and evolving constantly.\nWhile the industry’s natural volatility will remain for the foreseeable future, its maturation is driven by innovation and a stronger, more stable infrastructure. This foundation will allow the industry to focus on addressing challenges and increasing adoption.\nDespite the industry’s notorious unpredictability, several possible overlooked trends could have a huge impact on the broader ecosystem.\nEmergence of DeFi regulatory frameworks\nRegulators have a hard time applying clear rules to DeFi because if a network or protocol isn’t controlled by a single entity, who can the government contact in case of a violation or concern? While DeFi is currently exempt from direct oversight, the US, EU, and UK are exploring ways to legislate this rapidly evolving sector effectively.\nIn the US, the House of Representatives just last week voted to repeal an IRS rule that required DeFi protocols to report their earnings from crypto sales. This step likely indicates that the Trump administration will lean toward a regulatory outline that will attempt to protect investors without disrupting the decentralized and innovative nature of DeFi.\nIt’s unlikely that any comprehensive DeFi regulation will be enacted by the end of the year, but a better understanding of what policies and approaches policymakers may take can be expected. DeFi will likely continue to adopt know-your-customer and anti-money laundering processes, as well as a greater emphasis on solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, which could serve as an effective way to enhance DeFi compliance. This is the ideal type of approach as it balances privacy with the need to maintain KYC and AML compliance.\nA different kind of TradFi influence\nTraditional finance and crypto have been increasingly crossing paths as the former now recognizes the latter as a legitimate asset class. TradFi’s steadily increasing interest in digital assets has partially contributed to a growing awareness of the need for better risk mitigation.\nPortfolio diversification is a central pillar of mitigating financial risk and indexes have historically proven to be a more effective investing tool than actively managed funds. As more retail investors enter the space, crypto indexes like J’JO35, which offers exposure to the top 35 tokens by market capitalization, could become a popular choice due to its track record of steady, long-term growth with minimal effort.\nWhile last year saw the introduction of spot ETFs to crypto, 2025 may very well be the year that index investing finally plays a more prominent role in the digital asset ecosystem.\nAI and crypto wallets\nAI’s expanding role within crypto has been well documented, from AI trading algorithms and compliance to smart contract optimization and beyond. While the crypto industry has been one of the most aggressive industries in its approach to implementing agentic AI, the next big AI use case in crypto may be the use of voice assistants in crypto wallets.\nTether made a splash in February when it announced that it would soon launch a series of AI apps that include an “AI Bitcoin wallet assistant.” This wallet assistant will help users manage transactions, track price changes, and keep funds secure—all via spoken commands. Tether has also introduced an SDK for developers to build customized AI agents for voice-controlled payment solutions.\nTOMI, a web3 infrastructure project building a privacy-oriented decentralized internet, just recently launched the first AI-powered voice assistant for a web3 wallet. This addition to the TOMI Wallet offers hands-free engagement with digital assets, enabling an intuitive and smoother user experience. With more AI voice command capabilities coming to other crypto wallets, such as GlobalEth’s SimplifAI demo, this development is part of the broader trend to integrate AI to improve the user experience.",

        "content": "HBAR loses key support: Hedera Hashgraph eyes 30% crash\nThe Hedera Hashgraph token crashed below a key support level, signaling that bears prevailed.\nHedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) dropped to a low of $0.1750, its lowest level since December 1 last year. It has plunged by over 57% from its highest level this year.\nThe ongoing HBAR price crash has coincided with a decline of total assets in its decentralized finance ecosystem. Data shows that the total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem has crashed to 531 million HBAR tokens, down from last year’s high of 1.33 billion.\nMost dApps on its ecosystem have lost assets in the past few months. Stader, a top liquid staking network, has shed 11% of its assets in the last 30 days to $81 million. Bonzo Finance has shed 6.8% of its assets, while HeliSwap and HbarSuite have also lost assets.\nHedera’s app revenue has also continued falling in the past few months. In March, it was just $9,700, down from $124,000 in December.\nThe only potential catalyst for Hedera price is the potential HBAR ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such an approval would lead to more demand from US institutional investors.\nHBAR price technical analysis\nTechnical indicators point to more Hedera Hashgraph price crashes. It has moved below the key support at $0.1817, a key support level that has failed to move below several times since February this year. Moving below that level is a sign that bears have prevailed.\nHedera has also formed a death cross pattern, as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages have flipped each other. It has also moved below the 61.3% Fibonacci Retracement level, where most pullbacks happen.\nTherefore, the path of least resistance for HBAR is downward. The next target is $0.1200, the 78.6% retracement point, which is about 31% below the current level.",

Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nEthereum has dropped to $1,874, testing a key support level as selling pressure intensifies across the broader crypto market. With prices inching dangerously close to critical liquidation thresholds around $1,805, analysts warn that a sharper correction could be on the horizon.\nThis downturn places $238 million worth of ETH at risk, as two major MakerDAO whales face potential liquidation. As the market braces for volatility, traders are closely watching whether bulls can defend current levels—or if bears are preparing to force a deeper breakdown.\nWhales at Risk: $238M ETH Faces Liquidation\nThe latest ETH sell-off is testing the resilience of highly leveraged DeFi positions. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , two large Ethereum holders on MakerDAO are on the verge of liquidation. Combined, they hold 125,603 ETH, currently valued at $238 million.\nAs Ethereum trades near $1,874, their positions are approaching liquidation triggers at $1,805 and $1,787. The health rate of these vaults—a key indicator of collateral stability—has now dropped to 1.07, raising the likelihood of forced asset sales.\nIf ETH falls below these levels, the Maker protocol will automatically liquidate collateral, potentially flooding the market with ETH and triggering a broader wave of sell pressure across DeFi.\nThis scenario could amplify bearish momentum and rattle confidence in leveraged on-chain strategies.\nEthereum Price Action Signals Further Weakness\nEthereum has broken below its symmetrical triangle support near $1,880, a key level that had held for weeks. The current price action around $1,850 suggests increasing selling pressure. Technical indicators provide little comfort for bulls:\nRelative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 28, signaling extreme oversold conditions.\n-\nThe 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart sits at $1,955, well above current price levels.\n-\nAn ABCD harmonic pattern completed near the recent low, hinting at continuation of the bearish move.\n-\nIf Ethereum breaks decisively below $1,822, the next support zones lie at $1,754 and $1,680. Only a recovery above $1,880 and a close above $1,955 would indicate a meaningful trend reversal.\nMarket Outlook: DeFi Liquidations in Focus\nThe potential liquidation of whale-sized positions highlights a persistent risk in decentralized finance—automated liquidations with no manual stop-losses. While DeFi offers transparency, its rigid mechanics can lead to sharp, sudden moves during periods of volatility.\nKey Points to Watch:\nA breakdown below $1,805 could trigger liquidation of 125K ETH.\n-\nRSI suggests conditions are oversold, but recovery remains uncertain.\n-\nETH must reclaim $1,880–$1,955 to regain bullish structure.\n-\nWhile oversold readings could prompt a temporary bounce, the looming threat of major liquidations suggests downside risks remain elevated unless sentiment shifts swiftly.\nBTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale\nBTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities.\nStaking & Passive Income Opportunities\nBTC Bull offers a high-yield staking program with an impressive 119% APY, allowing users to generate passive income. The staking pool has already attracted 882.5 million BTCBULL tokens, highlighting strong community participation.\nLatest Presale Updates:\nCurrent Presale Price: $0.002435 per BTCBULL\n-\nTotal Raised: $4.2M / $4.8M target\n-\nWith demand surging, this presale provides an opportunity to acquire BTCBULL at early-stage pricing before the next price increase.",

Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nBitcoin’s price has drawn renewed attention following the activation of a historically reliable on-chain signal—the Hash Ribbon indicator. Currently trading around $84,500 after a 3.9% drop over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) is under pressure from broader macro uncertainty.\nHowever, the Hash Ribbon , which measures miner stress and recovery using 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages, has now flashed its eighth major buy signal in BTC’s history.\nDeveloped by Charles Edwards, this signal occurs when the 30-day MA crosses above the 60-day MA, suggesting miner capitulation has ended. Historically, BTC has never dropped lower in 85% of previous cases following this signal.\nMarket commentators, including Bitcoin Archive, emphasize that in all seven prior instances, BTC rallied significantly post-signal, with no false triggers.\nBTC is down 3.9% over 24 hours, trading at $84.5K\n-\nHash Ribbon signal appeared only 20 times in BTC’s history\n-\nHistorically accurate in 85% of cases, signaling limited downside\n-\nMixed Market Signals: A Warning from the Charts\nDespite the optimism, technical analysts remain divided. Tony Severino, a Chartered Market Technician, flagged bearish divergences between price action and momentum indicators. “BTC is making higher highs while the RSI posts lower highs. That’s not bullish—it’s a red flag,” he noted.\nBTC remains below the 50-period EMA near $86,000, reinforcing short-term bearish structure. The RSI sits around 36, rebounding from oversold levels, but lacks momentum. Unless BTC breaks above $86,800, recovery remains uncertain.\nMacroeconomic Headwinds Add Caution\nEven with the bullish on-chain signal, macro forces loom large. Strong U.S. economic data—Q4 GDP revised to 3.4% and jobless claims declining—supports a hawkish Fed stance, dampening appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin.\nMeanwhile, geopolitical tensions are flaring again with Trump’s proposed 25% auto tariffs, set for April 2. While gold surged to an all-time high of $3,059 on the news, BTC hasn’t mirrored the safe-haven rally.\nThis divergence has left some questioning Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision noted, “Hash Ribbons are a solid signal, but broader conditions aren’t aligning like previous cycles.”\nWith Wall Street returning post-holiday and ETF flows stabilizing, short-term direction may depend on how BTC reacts to upcoming inflation data.\nGold hits $3,059 ATH while BTC lags behind\n-\nTrump’s tariffs add to global economic anxiety\n-\nETF inflows flatline amid mixed crypto sentiment\n-\nBitcoin Consolidates Near $84.5K Amid Cooling Bearish Pressure\nBTC is stabilizing near $84,500 after a sharp drop, finding short-term support at $83,000. The RSI is rebounding from oversold levels, hinting at fading bearish momentum.\nHowever, BTC remains below the 50-EMA at $86,000, keeping the near-term bias bearish.\nUpside target : Break above $86,800 could trigger a rally toward $88,800\n-\nDownside risk : Drop below $83,000 may expose $81,200\n-\nMarket tone : Cautious, with $34B daily volume and 2.86% drop\n-\nBTC is consolidating in a narrowing range, with macro catalysts likely to dictate the next move.\nBTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale\nBTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones.

        "content": "Missed PEPE & WIF? PEPETO’s Presale Could Be Your Second Chance\nWe believe in full transparency with our readers. Some of our content includes affiliate links, and we may earn a commission through these partnerships. However, this potential compensation never influences our analysis, opinions, or reviews. Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nLet’s compare PEPETO’s $5.2 million presale at $$0.000000119 with early PEPE and WIF investments, examining utility advantages through 30-second bridge transfers.\nEarly meme coin investors who bought PEPE or WIF before their growth phases saw life-changing returns. But many missed these opportunities, leaving them searching for similar entry points in the next potential breakout token.\nPEPETO’s presale has now hit $5.2 million at a price of $0.000000119 per token. The project combines meme appeal with practical cross-chain bridge technology that cuts transfer times from 15 minutes to 30 seconds.\nMost notably, PEPETO plans a zero-fee exchange platform where token listings cost nothing, explicitly stating “No listing costs, boosting liquidity” as a core feature.\nWhat Made PEPE & WIF Successful\nThe success stories of previous meme coins provide valuable insights for identifying potential future winners. PEPE and WIF followed similar patterns despite launching in different market conditions.\nBoth started with accessible entry prices, allowing substantial token accumulation with modest investment amounts. This low barrier to entry helped create a broad initial distribution among many holders.\nCommunity momentum played an equally important role. Both projects built passionate follower bases through creative marketing and cultural relevance. This social momentum created viral growth cycles where each new wave of buyers brought additional awareness.\nTiming their launches during growing market optimism also contributed to their success. PEPE and WIF rode broader market waves rather than fighting against bearish sentiment. Their growth phases coincided with periods when risk appetite increased across the crypto market.\nPEPETO’s presale position at $0.000000119 shares several characteristics with these earlier success stories. The six zeros in its price create a similar entry dynamic where even small investments purchase substantial token quantities.\nBeyond Memes: How PEPETO Adds What PEPE & WIF Lacked\nPEPE and WIF succeeded despite lacking practical utility. Both tokens offered minimal functionality beyond basic transfers. Their value was driven almost entirely by community excitement rather than practical applications.\nTheir growth came from social momentum alone, making them vulnerable to sentiment shifts when hype inevitably cooled.\nPEPETO takes a fundamentally different approach by building actual utility from day one. The cross-chain bridge technology addresses a clear market pain point by cutting transfer times from 15 minutes to 30 seconds and fees from $50 to $5. This practical value creates revenue streams that neither PEPE nor WIF ever developed.\nThe zero-fee exchange platform adds another utility layer. The no-listing cost approach helps smaller projects access trading markets while creating more diverse user options.\nThe presale funds raised provide development funding for these utility features while maintaining a similar entry price structure to early PEPE and WIF. This combination (meme coin appeal with genuine utility) is a hybrid model that potentially addresses meme coins’ weaknesses.\nStaking Advantage: What Previous Meme Winners Missed\nPEPE and WIF launched without strong staking programs, creating different holder dynamics than what PEPETO currently builds . Without staking incentives, early PEPE and WIF investors faced pure speculation with no passive income benefits.\nPEPETO creates a completely different participation model through its staking program , offering 300% estimated annual rewards. Nearly 28 trillion tokens already staked show how this approach changes holder behavior from the beginning.\nRather than seeking immediate exits, these stakers commit to longer time horizons, potentially reducing selling pressure during early price discovery phases.\nThe psychological impact of daily reward distributions creates another distinction from previous meme successes. When holders see their token balances grow automatically each day, they develop stronger emotional connections to the project.\nFor investors who missed early PEPE or WIF entries, this staking feature offers something those projects never provided. At the current price, stakers can accumulate more tokens through rewards regardless of immediate market movements.\nTiming Window: Presale vs Post-Launch Entry\nTiming created a critical distinction between those who made fortunes on PEPE and WIF versus those who bought after major price movements had occurred. The earliest buyers entered at prices multiple zeros lower than later participants.\nPEPETO’s current presale at $0.000000117 creates a similar pre-launch position. The $5 million raised so far provides meaningful project backing while maintaining this ground-floor price point before exchange listings and major development milestones. This phase represents the earliest possible entry – comparable to buying PEPE or WIF before they reached major exchanges.\nUnlike PEPE and WIF’s beginnings, PEPETO enters with clear technological goals for its bridge and zero-fee exchange. This structured approach potentially offers both the early entry advantages of previous meme winners and the sustainability that many of them lacked.\nTo join at this price point, investors can purchase through the official website using ETH, USDT, or bank cards. This can be done by connecting any of the supported wallets.\nCheck out the PEPETO social media channels : PEPETO Presale , Twitter , Telegram , YouTube , Instagram .",

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nStellar (XLM), the low-cost cross-border payment protocol and rival to XRP, has yielded to bearish pressure in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap data shows that XLM has reversed the previous gains recorded within the last seven days in the crypto market.\nXLM plunges amid market volatility\nNotably, the XLM price plunged from $0.301 to $0.2661 as it experienced intense market volatility. The significant drop has severely impacted the coin, threatening to send it to its 30-day low of $0.2301 if it fails to find crucial support.\nMarket trends suggest that XLM has been on a bullish path. Technical indicators showed the coin in an ascending triangle, signaling a potential breakout. However, it encountered resistance, and with no definitive buyups in the short term, the coin had nowhere to go but crash.\nAccording to market indicators, investors have remained cautious about XLM in the past 24 hours. The trading volume during this time has dropped significantly by 25.46% to $154.48 million.\nXLM had anticipated a bullish rally from the price breakout before investors' pullback. However, the possibility of a quick rebound has faded, and the price is still on a downward spiral.\nInterestingly, despite this volatility, XLM’s November-to-date performance outshines XRP's. XLM has seen growth above 500% in the past five months compared to XRP. In November, XLM offered more profit to investors than its rival, XRP.\nWhere will XLM find support?\nThe historical bullish performance of XLM had boosted investor confidence that the momentum might continue. Traders had anticipated that XLM would hold its momentum into April after soaring to $0.301. Some market participants looked forward to the coin retesting the $0.40 level.\nAs of this writing, XLM was changing hands at $0.2644, representing a 4.23% decline in the last 24 hours. Market observers are keen to see where XLM can find support to halt its rapid decline.",

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nThe price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fall — that would be enough to describe the current situation in the cryptocurrency market. However, and fortunately, it's a place where things rarely stay the same for long, and the upcoming month of April has a great chance to prove this point.\nThus, as it became known thanks to data from CryptoRank , the average return for Bitcoin in the fourth month of the year stands at 34.7%, and this is actually the second best month in the price history of the cryptocurrency in terms of gains.\nOnly November was better with an average return of 40.5%. Moreover, an even more accurate and time-adjusted median indicator also signals gains for Bitcoin in the coming month with a figure of 5.32%.\nOn the one hand, the price of BTC and April, or \"Upril\" and \"APEril\" as some crypto enthusiasts call this month, are a good pair from a historical perspective.\nOn the other hand, as it is always the other way around, Bitcoin has only closed April with a gain once since 2021, and that was a 3.05% spike in 2023.\nYes, one can argue that 2022, 2023 and even 2024 were bear market and then rally years. Still, the historical facts are there and they put a cold shower on the hopes of a 34% jump in Bitcoin next month.\nAll in all, price history is just one of the tools used to try to predict what will happen next in the crypto market, and the insights from it are not set in stone. For Bitcoin though, it offers a bit more as the asset itself has been publicly traded for over 14 years, so the stat cut is big enough.",

        "content": "Kiyosaki: FOMO crowd investing in Bitcoin will ‘accelerate’ into generational wealth\nFinancial author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a warning about traditional currencies while advising his followers to earn and save in alternative assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies.\nThe “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author specifically highlighted silver as his top near-term investment pick.\n“For many, many years I have been recommending people not save ‘fake money’ a.k.a. FIAT government money,” Kiyosaki stated in an X tweet. “For years I have recommended saving real gold and silver coins…recently Bitcoin ( BTC ). Unfortunately most people work for and save ‘fake money.'”\nKiyosaki emphasized his belief that traditional currency savers face decreasing purchasing power through what he calls “government theft known as ‘inflation.'” He urged followers to start working for and saving gold, silver, and Bitcoin as a hedge against this devaluation.\nKiyosaki expresses enthusiasm for silver\nAmong these alternatives, Kiyosaki expressed particular enthusiasm for silver’s prospects over the next two months. “Today silver is about $35 an ounce. I believe silver may soon be $70 an ounce this year and $200 in a year or two,” he stated.\nThe financial educator highlighted silver’s accessibility, noting that almost everyone can afford at least one silver coin today….but not tomorrow.\nIn a tweet from March 24, he addressed psychological barriers preventing people from investing in assets like Bitcoin.\n“Most of us have heard of FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out. Yet…the main reason poor people remain poor is due to FOMM: Fear of Making Mistakes,” Kiyosaki wrote. He argued that Bitcoin has made it easy for everyone to become rich, but many will miss the opportunity due to this fear of making errors.\nKiyosaki suggested that “the FOMO crowd investing in Bitcoin will accelerate into generational wealth” while “the FOMM crowd will wait till Bitcoin passed $200k this year and say ‘Bitcoin is too expensive.'”\nThe financial author encouraged his audience to conduct independent research by following figures who both support and criticize Bitcoin. He suggested following Jeff Booth, Michael Saylor, and Samson Mow.\nKiyosaki also emphasized that “the most important financial education is no longer from schools or Wall Street” but is freely available through platforms like YouTube.",

As such, its recent short-lived price upsurge looks like a \"dead cat bounce.\" Such a pessimistic statement was made by Koroush AK, a seasoned cryptocurrency trader and researcher on his X on March 28, 2025.\nIn an analysis shared with his 374,000 followers, Koroush AK also indicated that Bitcoin (BTC) just failed its fifth consecutive attempt to stay above $90,000:\nPrice failed to reach $90K this week after trying for 5 days in a row. A lot of salty comments that got euphoric on the LTF pump now second-guessing their opinions\nThe current level might not be the final point of Bitcoin's (BTC) dropdown. As demonstrated by Koroush AK on his chart, the Bitcoin (BTC) price might extend its plunge to $72,000-$73,000 zones.\nShould this prediction play out, Bitcoin (BTC) would drop exactly to the levels of early November 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) will hence erase all gains triggered by the U.S. Presidential elections' effects.\nBy press time, Bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $82,500, being 2.22% down in the last 24 hours.\nIs Bitcoin (BTC) correction still healthy?\nThe cryptocurrency market benchmark is down by 2.38% today.\nFor every Bitcoin (BTC) bullish cycle, coming through seven-eight painful corrections looks regular.\nAs U.Today previously mentioned, top analysts indicate a 35-45% pullback as healthy price performance that does not affect the domination of the bullish uptrend.\nGiven the current peak Bitcoin (BTC) price of $109,000, the hypothetical bottom of such \"correction\" might be somewhere near $60,000.",

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T11:31:00+0000",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nCardano (ADA) , now the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading around a key support level near $0.69. At the time of writing, ADA was down 2.63% in the last 24 hours to $0.682 and down 4.65% weekly.\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali, if ADA manages to sustain this level, it could trigger a rebound toward the $0.77 mark. The essence of the $0.68 to $0.69 support range was seen this month with ADA rebounding twice from here in March. Cardano rose to highs of $0.77 following Sunday, March 23's rebound from $0.69.\nThe crypto market saw a sudden downturn on Friday, wiping out gains from earlier in the week. Bitcoin plunged as much as 5% to around $83,000 on Friday, erasing much of the week's gains. Cardano also fell, continuing its decline from Wednesday's high of $0.774. After plunging to lows of $0.689 on Friday, Cardano hit intraday lows of $0.677 on Saturday before recovering marginally to where it presently trades.\nThe drop in crypto prices coincided with a sell-off in U.S. stocks owing to weak economic data, as macroeconomic concerns continued to weigh on the larger crypto market. Hopes for the cryptocurrency rebound to continue were dashed on Friday, as a market-wide meltdown erased nearly all gains from earlier this week.\nMarket sees sell-off\nThe crypto market is currently trading in losses in the early Saturday session, extending Friday's slump, with the majority of digital assets down as investors considered a higher-than-expected inflation report. The February PCE inflation report, released on Friday, showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, somewhat higher than anticipated.\nIn the last 24 hours, crypto derivatives traders have suffered $308 million in liquidations, according to CoinGlass data. The majority of this figure came from leveraged longs, traders expecting crypto prices to rise, totaling $270 million.\nIn the coming session, traders and investors will keep a careful eye on ADA's price behavior near important support levels, first at $0.69 and subsequently at $0.64. A strong rise over the daily moving averages of 50 and 200, at $0.754 and $0.723, would be the first sign of strength, with a target of $1. Cardano is currently at a key juncture, with its next move likely influenced by broader market trends and investor sentiment.",

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T00:25:16+00:00",
        "content": "Fidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.”\nIn a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time.\nHe noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years.\nTimmer wrote:\n“If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.”\nThe prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor .\nInstitutional momentum\nTimmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak.\nThe price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs , reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven.\nDespite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows.\nThe continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture.\nSaylor sees $500 trillion market cap\nWhile Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast.\nSpeaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth.\nSaylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells.\nSaylor added that the US has the “ opportunity to grab ” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization.\nStill, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up.\nFor now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.",

        "content": "Elon Musk Sells X to xAI Amid Legal Setback, Sparking Controversy\nElon Musk has sold his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, to his artificial intelligence startup xAI in an all-stock transaction that has drawn both attention and criticism.\nThe announcement came on March 28, coinciding with a U.S. judge’s rejection of Musk’s attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit related to his acquisition of Twitter.\nThe lawsuit accuses Musk of misleading former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial stake in the company.\nCritics Say xAI’s Acquisition of X Raises Legal Stakes for Elon Musk\nWith xAI now owning X, critics say the legal stakes have grown.\n“It’s a whole lot spicier now,” said Adam Cochran , a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, adding that the move exposes xAI to legal risk as well.\nMusk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, incorporating $12 billion in debt. He originally purchased X for around $44 billion in April 2022.\nAnnouncing the merger, Musk wrote, “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined… This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capabilities with X’s massive reach.”\nCochran, however, criticized the structure of the deal, alleging that Musk used xAI’s inflated valuation to absorb X at an overestimated price while still reporting a significant loss.\n“He’s screwing over xAI investors and X investors,” Cochran argued, suggesting the deal may be a mechanism to transfer user data to xAI.\nxAI is the creator of Grok, an AI chatbot integrated into X that Musk claims outperforms the original version of ChatGPT on several academic benchmarks.\nMusk has positioned Grok as a tool designed to assist human progress and support research.\nStill, the $80 billion valuation for xAI has drawn skepticism. “An insanely dumb valuation,” Cochran said, while others, including crypto developer “Keef,” defended the move, saying Grok may well be a leading model for various AI tasks.\nElon Musk’s DOGE Team Gains Access to SEC Systems\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly being integrated into the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a newly formed liaison initiative.\nAs reported, the SEC has agreed to allow DOGE representatives access to its internal systems and data, effectively treating them as staff for integration and network purposes.\nAn internal SEC email cited in the report confirmed that DOGE team members will be granted the same access rights as SEC employees when it comes to networks, systems, and sensitive data.\nThe SEC has begun assembling a dedicated liaison team tasked with working alongside DOGE representatives.\nThe internal communication emphasized that all processes will adhere to standard protocols, including ethics clearances, IT security reviews, and access approvals.\nWhile specific goals of DOGE’s work with the SEC have not yet been made public, the collaboration raises questions about the role private-sector influence may play in regulatory frameworks moving forward.",

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Ethereum Layer 2 Roadmap and Advocates Open Source Funding",
        "published_time": "2025-03-29T15:30:00+00:00",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a new roadmap aimed at strengthening the security and finality of Layer 2 (L2) solutions.\nHis proposal introduces a flexible, multi-proof system designed to support Ethereum’s scalability while preserving its core principles of decentralization and trust minimization.\nEthereum’s New Layer 2 Roadmap\nAt the heart of Buterin’s technical framework is a “2-of-3” model. This system uses three different proof types—optimistic, zero-knowledge (ZK) , and trusted execution environment (TEE) provers.\nA transaction is finalized when any two of these agree, significantly reducing the risk tied to relying on a single-proof method. The model offers a pragmatic balance between speed, robustness, and decentralization.\nButerin emphasized the importance of diversification, especially as zero-knowledge systems mature. He warned that shared code among ZK rollups could cause bugs to propagate across implementations, raising systemic risk.\n“This means that the finality of rollups can be as fast as zk proving (~<1hr for now) while protecting the system from soundness bugs in the zk system,” Wei Dai , a research partner at 1kxnetwork, explained .\nMeanwhile, Buterin’s roadmap also lays out the requirements for what he calls “Stage 2 rollups.” These next-generation rollups would deliver near-instant confirmations, high finality, and strong resistance to failures—even in semi-trusted environments.\nImportantly, they would still adhere to Ethereum’s 30-day upgrade delay , a rule that safeguards the network’s stability during transitions.\nButerin Makes Case for Open-Source Funding\nBeyond scalability, Buterin is also advocating a cultural shift in how the crypto community approaches development funding.\nIn a separate blog post , he suggested shifting the focus from “public goods funding” to “open-source funding.”\nHis concern is that the phrase “public goods” has become politically and socially loaded, often used in ways that prioritize perception over impact.\n“A big part of the reason why the term ‘public good’ is vulnerable to social gaming is precisely the fact that the definition of ‘public good’ is stretched so easily,” Buterin argued\nHe noted that public goods funding is vulnerable to social desirability bias. This often favors those who can navigate community politics over those who deliver meaningful value.\nIn contrast, open-source funding emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and the building of tools that genuinely benefit the broader ecosystem.\nButerin believes that the goal should not be to fund any open-source project indiscriminately but to support those that create maximum value for humanity.\nThis stance aligns with his broader vision of a sustainable, community-driven blockchain infrastructure.\nTogether, Buterin’s proposals could redefine both the technical direction of Ethereum’s scalability efforts and the philosophical foundations of its funding strategies—reinforcing the network’s long-term commitment to decentralization, security, and public benefit.\nDisclaimer\nIn adherence to the Trust Project guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.

        "content": "Nasdaq Files 19b-4 for Grayscale Avalanche (AVAX) ETF Listing\nNasdaq has officially filed Form 19b-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a move to list and trade shares of Grayscale’s Avalanche ( AVAX ) Trust.\nGrayscale aims to convert its existing trust product into a publicly traded exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe proposed AVAX ETF is part of a broader wave of crypto ETF filings as asset managers look to capitalize on the regulatory momentum following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year.\nThe filing comes amid increasing interest in AVAX, which ranks as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nIf approved, this ETF would provide investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to gain exposure to AVAX.\nThe submission follows VanEck’s recent S-1 filing for a similar AVAX-based investment product, indicating a competitive race to introduce the first AVAX ETF.\nGrayscale’s move also aligns with its broader strategy of expanding its portfolio of cryptocurrency ETFs, which already includes pending applications for XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT).\nGrowing Institutional Interest in Altcoin ETFs\nGrayscale’s latest filing is part of a growing trend of institutional interest in altcoin ETFs as asset managers seek to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe trend has accelerated in response to changing regulatory dynamics and increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets.\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year set a precedent, encouraging firms to pursue ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies.\nGrayscale’s submission of its AVAX ETF follows similar filings for Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , Cardano (ADA) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) .\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts that Litecoin and Hedera have some of the strongest approval odds among altcoin ETFs, given their progress with regulatory engagement.\nThe SEC’s cautious but evolving stance suggests that while immediate approvals remain uncertain, the growing wave of filings indicates a broader acceptance of crypto-based financial products.\nAdditionally, Nasdaq has been at the forefront of these developments, having filed multiple 19b-4 forms for crypto ETFs.\nJust earlier this month, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submitted a 19b-4 application for Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF , further intensifying the competition among asset managers to secure a foothold in the expanding crypto ETF market.\nSEC’s Stance and Market Implications\nThe SEC’s handling of these applications will be a key indicator of its evolving approach to crypto regulation.\nWhile the agency has historically been hesitant to approve spot cryptocurrency ETFs, recent shifts in political and regulatory sentiment suggest a more favorable outlook.\nThe reelection of Donald Trump and his administration’s perceived crypto-friendly stance have spurred a wave of new ETF filings as issuers anticipate a more accommodating regulatory environment.\nThe SEC’s acknowledgment of Nasdaq’s Hedera (HBAR) ETF proposal last week triggered a 21-day public comment period, allowing industry stakeholders to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. A similar process is expected for the AVAX ETF.\nIn the broader market, the growing acceptance of altcoin ETFs could have significant implications for institutional investment strategies.\nIf approved, these ETFs would offer investors a more accessible and regulated means of gaining exposure to digital assets, potentially driving increased liquidity and market stability.\nMoreover, the launch of altcoin ETFs could influence the SEC’s stance on other pending applications.\nWith firms like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise actively pursuing ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, there is high hope for approval.\nParticularly, if Grayscale’s AVAX ETF secures approval, it could push for broader institutional adoption of Avalanche and similar blockchain networks.\nFor now, the community awaits the SEC’s response, which will play a crucial role in deciding others’ fates.",

        "content": "XRP price loses momentum, risking a crash to $1 if this happens\nThe XRP price has lost momentum this week, falling for four consecutive days and reaching its lowest point since March 11.\nRipple ( XRP ), like other altcoins, has crashed as concerns about the state of the U.S. economy and President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on April 2.\nData released on Friday showed that inflation rose in February while consumer spending slowed. This report came a few days after the Conference Board said consumer confidence dropped in March. The consumer confidence figure pushed Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody’s , to warn that recession odds were rising.\nThese risks have led to panic among the stock and crypto markets. The U.S. stock market crashed, with the top three indices, Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500, falling by over 2%.\nThese risks have prevented the XRP price from surging even after some notable bullish news. For example, Ripple entered a deal with Chipper Cash , a popular fintech company in Africa that will now use its technology to handle transactions.\nRipple also received a money transmitter license in New York in January, and this week, it received a license from the United Arab Emirates.\nThe recent decision by the SEC to end its lawsuit against Ripple Labs has also led to more deal-making. In an interview with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo , Brad Garlinghouse said that more American companies were willing to partner with the company.\nRipple’s goal is to disrupt the 50-year-old model by SWIFT, which handles over $150 trillion in cash each year. It aims to connect banks and money transfer companies globally and provide them with a faster and cheaper alternative.\nXRP price technical analysis\nThe daily chart shows that the XRP price has crashed in the past few months. It peaked at $3.40 in January and has now plunged to $2.31.\nThe risk is that the coin has formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $1.96. Its shoulders are at $3, while the head is at $3.40. H&S is one of the riskiest patterns in technical analysis.\nXRP has also formed a symmetrical triangle pattern with two lines nearing their confluence level. Therefore, a drop below the key support at $1.9515 will point to more downside, potentially to $1.\nThis support is the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point and also the neckline of the H&S pattern. A drop to $1 would signify a 53% crash from the current level.",

        "content": "Buckle up: Solana price prepares a wild ride as risks rise\nSolana price crashed for two straight days as the ongoing crypto market sell-off hit its meme coin ecosystem.\nSolana ( SOL ) dropped to $127 on Saturday, down by 15% from its highest point this week. It has dropped to its lowest level since March 2021.\nThe decline happened as most Solana meme coins crashed, erasing most of the gains made earlier this week. Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) crashed by 15% on Saturday, while popular tokens like Popcat ( POPCAT ), ai16z ( AI16Z ), and Bonk ( BONK ) fell by over 10%.\nThe market cap of all Solana meme coins tracked by over 10% to $7.2 billion. This drop means that these tokens have erased over $18 billion in value in the last few days.\nThird-party data shows that crypto traders bought the Solana meme coin rally earlier this week.\nAccording to DeFi Llama , Solana’s DEX volume soared by 60% in the last seven days to over $3 billion. This volume was higher than Ethereum ( ETH ) and BSC, which handled $11.35 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. It was the first time in weeks that Solana’s DEX protocols did better than the two.\nMost of Solana’s DEX volume came from Pump, which handled over $2.8 billion worth of transactions. It beat other popular DEX networks like Orca, Meteora, Raydium, and Lifinity, which have long had a big market share.\nSolana had some other positive news this week. The most notable one was that Blackrock, the biggest asset manager globally, expanded BUIDL , its money market fund, to the network. This is a notable development since BUIDL’s assets have surged to over $1.86 billion .\nSolana price technical analysis\nThe daily chart shows that Solana coin has plunged in the past few months, moving from January’s high of $295.45 to $126. Most recently, it has formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a tall vertical line and a rectangle.\nSolana also formed a death cross pattern on March 4 as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages flipped each other while pointing downwards.\nTherefore, a combination of a death cross and a bearish flag points to a strong breakdown, potentially to $100. For this to happen, it will need to plunge below the support at $120, where it has failed to drop below several times since April last year.",

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nA veteran trader, considered by many to be a legend in the field, Peter Brandt , who has been in the financial market since the 1970s, is no snob when it comes to looking at the charts of the newest class of assets, cryptocurrencies.\nIn particular, his recent interest has been focused on XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency by capitalization and one of the old-timers on the market. Earlier this week, Brandt highlighted an emerging head-and-shoulders pattern in XRP's price action, with targets ranging from $3 to $1.07.\nHowever, the expert trader decided to double down on his XRP price outlook and recently dropped an update on the situation.\nXRP price outlook by Peter Brandt\nBrandt reports that XRP is forming a classic complex head-and-shoulders top, which appears to have been formed back in January when the price of the coin hit a new all-time high of $3.4. After that, XRP reversed into a downtrend and failed to even make it back to the $3 mark.\nFor Brandt , if the price fails to break above $3, which is the only way to turn on bullish mode, the implications will be a decline to $1.07. The latter is almost 50% below the current price, and with XRP's market capitalization at $121 billion, such a decline would mean the wiping out of nearly $60 billion.\nTo estimate the damage, here's a good example — the market cap of Solana is a total of $64 billion. Whether this outcome will turn from a nightmare for XRP holders into reality remains to be seen.\nBut according to Peter Brandt, the possibility already exists.",

Some of our content includes affiliate links, and we may earn a commission through these partnerships. However, this potential compensation never influences our analysis, opinions, or reviews. Our editorial content is created independently of our marketing partnerships, and our ratings are based solely on our established evaluation criteria. Read More\nSUI has gained 6% this week, outperforming broader market weakness while maintaining support above an ascending trendline near $2.29. Despite a sharp 10.17% decline in the past 24 hours, the price remains technically supported by concentrated buying activity at key levels.\nNow trading at $2.30, SUI/USDT has stabilized at the intersection of trendline and horizontal support, maintaining its short-term upward structure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from an oversold reading of 27, indicating a potential pause or reversal in the recent selloff.\nWhile downward pressure remains below the 50-period EMA, a decisive move above $2.40 could shift momentum toward the next resistance levels.\nMarket Cap and Adoption Signal Growing Demand\nSUI ranks #17 by market cap, currently valued at $7.29 billion, with 3.16 billion tokens in circulation. The asset continues to attract attention, fueled by strong ecosystem developments and rising global interest.\nThe recent SUI Gaming Summit highlighted upcoming Web3 projects and tools aimed at developers, positioning the network as a hub for blockchain-based gaming.\nAdoption is also gaining momentum in underrepresented regions—SUI’s footprint in African markets grew 6x this year, marking a significant expansion in reach and use case potential.\nTogether, these trends reflect increasing confidence in SUI’s long-term utility, beyond short-term speculation.\nSUI: Bullish Setup or Dead-Cat Bounce?\nWhether SUI’s 6% weekly gain marks the beginning of a sustained rally will depend on both technical confirmation and ecosystem follow-through.\nWhile the token has held up well at major support, it remains below the 50-period EMA—a key technical hurdle. A move above $2.50 could set the stage for a retest of $2.61, while a breakdown below $2.29 risks deeper losses toward $2.23.\nKey watchpoints for traders:\nBreak above $2.50 (EMA) to confirm upside momentum\n-\nProgress in GameFi and DeFi integration\n-\nContinued adoption in emerging crypto markets\n-\nIn short, SUI’s structure suggests promise, but the next leg will hinge on whether momentum is matched by meaningful on-chain growth and breakout confirmation.\nBest Wallet ($BEST): Crypto’s Next Big App\nBest Wallet ($BEST) is redefining the crypto wallet experience by combining security, functionality, and accessibility into one powerful platform. Available on Google Play and the App Store, this non-custodial wallet supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies, leveraging Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology to ensure optimal asset security.\nA standout feature is its “Upcoming Tokens” tool, granting users early access to promising crypto projects during presale phases, positioning them ahead of market trends.\nAdditionally, Best Wallet aggregates the market’s highest staking yields, allowing users to maximize returns from their crypto holdings.\nThe ongoing presale for $BEST tokens has now raised over $11.4 million, pricing tokens at $0.0245 each, with total staking surpassing 193 million $BEST tokens.\nInvestors benefit from estimated rewards of 137% annually, clearly indicating market confidence in Best Wallet’s innovative offerings as a competitive alternative to traditional exchanges.\nFollow Best Wallet on X and Telegram for the latest updates.",

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T18:00:00+00:00",
        "content": "ONDO is facing notable downside pressure. It has been down over 5% in the last 24 hours and corrected more than 19% over the past 30 days. With its market cap now sitting around $2.5 billion, the coin is way below competitors like Chainlink and Mantra in terms of market cap.\nRecent technical indicators and whale behavior suggest that the current weakness may not be over, despite a slight recovery in momentum.\nONDO RSI Is Recovering From Oversold Levels\nONDO’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is currently sitting at 34 after rebounding slightly from an earlier dip to 27.5. Just two days ago, the RSI was at 54.39, indicating how quickly momentum has shifted.\nThe RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. It ranges from 0 to 100.\nReadings below 30 are typically considered oversold, suggesting the asset may be undervalued and due for a bounce, while readings above 70 are viewed as overbought, indicating potential for a pullback.\nWith ONDO’s RSI now at 34, it has technically exited oversold territory but remains near the lower end of the scale. This suggests that while the sharpest selling pressure may have eased, the market is still fragile ,and sentiment remains cautious.\nIf the RSI continues to recover and climbs above 40 or 50, it could signal a shift toward more bullish momentum.\nHowever, if selling resumes and RSI falls back below 30, it would indicate renewed downside risk and potential for further price declines.\nWhales Recently Stopped Their Accumulation\nThe number of ONDO whales —addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ONDO—fluctuated in late March, initially increasing from 188 to 195 between March 22 and March 26 before declining to 191 in recent days.\nThis whale activity pattern is significant as these large holders often influence market sentiment and price movements, with their accumulation or distribution phases potentially foreshadowing broader market trends.\nTracking whale addresses provides valuable insights into how influential investors are positioning themselves, which can help predict potential price action.\nThe failure of Whale addresses to maintain the breakout above 195 and the subsequent return to 191 could signal bearish sentiment among larger investors.\nThis retreat might indicate that whales are taking profits or reducing exposure, which could create downward price pressure on ONDO in the short term.\nWhen large holders begin to reduce their positions after a period of accumulation, it often precedes price corrections, suggesting that ONDO may experience resistance in maintaining upward momentum until whale confidence returns and accumulation resumes.\nWill ONDO Fall Below $0.70 For The First Time Since November?\nONDO’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are currently aligned in a bearish formation, suggesting the ongoing downtrend may persist. If this weakness continues, ONDO could drop to test the key support level at $0.73.\nA break below that would be significant, potentially sending the price under $0.70 for the first time since November 2024.\nThe token has been struggling to keep pace with other Real World Asset (RWA) coins like Mantra, and this underperformance adds further pressure to ONDO’s short-term outlook.\nHowever, if sentiment shifts and ONDO manages to reverse its trend , the first key level to watch is the resistance at $0.82.\nA breakout above this level could trigger a broader recovery, with price targets at $0.90 and $0.95.\nIf the RWA sector as a whole regains momentum, ONDO could even rise above the $1 mark and aim for the next major resistance at $1.23.\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nXRP is witnessing massive volatility, with its price nosediving from $2.22 to $2.10 within the last 24 hours. Despite this development, XRP holders remain bullish, as reflected in the over 1 billion XRP committed to open interest within the same time frame.\nXRP predictions: $1.07 or $11\nCoinGlass data reveal that the total number of outstanding XRP futures invested in derivatives by traders stood at 1.74 billion XRP. This volume of XRP is worth $3.65 billion per current market value.\nThe increased open interest above 1 billion suggests that market activity still encourages investors to commit funds to the asset. Notably, open interest remains one of the key metrics used to gauge investors’ confidence.\nAnalysts opine that investors' bullish sentiments could be due to XRP's resilience and performance in the broader cryptocurrency market.\nFor instance, in the last 365 days, XRP has soared by a staggering 240%. XRP’s performance is over 10 times that of the leading digital currency, Bitcoin, which grew by 20.8%. As such, holders could expect that XRP would continue on this trajectory in the long term.\nVeteran traders have made diverse predictions about the possible price outlook of XRP. Peter Brandt has hinted that XRP’s head-and-shoulders pattern could drop the coin to $1.07 if it breaches the $1.90 support level.\nHowever, Dark Defender predicts a price breakout that could hit between $10 and $11 in an over 500% surge. Ali Martinez says if XRP rises above $3, it could upturn the head-and-shoulders pattern and market outlook.\nWill XRP break out before April?\nXRP has lost 5.69% of its value to trade at $2.09 as of this writing. However, trading volume remains in the green, with an uptick of 16.23% to $4.12 billion.\nMarket participants continue to anticipate an upward price shift as they close the final days of March. Only time will tell whether the breakout will occur before April.",

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T17:03:24+00:00",
        "content": "Revealed: America’s Crypto Clampdown on Hamas\nBack in April 2023, Hamas declared it was suspending all fundraising efforts through Bitcoin — primarily because donors were facing “hostile” activity.\nBut a new statement from the U.S. Justice Department suggests this pause didn’t last long.\nIt’s been revealed that American investigators have seized more than $200,000 worth of crypto intended for the militant group, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by many Western nations.\nFurther scrutiny of the addresses in question reveals that over $1.5 million in digital assets had been laundered since October of last year.\nAmerican officials have vowed to “search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas” — with U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. adding:\n“Hamas is responsible for the death of many U.S. and Israeli nationals, and we will stop at nothing to stop their campaign of terror and murder.”\nFBI agents added that every seizure of this kind “weakens their ability to function” — and deprives them of “resources they need to continue their illicit activity.”\nAccording to this statement, the crypto donations had been solicited through a group chat on an encrypted messaging platform. Hamas supporters were asked to send contributions to a rotating set of 17 addresses, with funds then laundered through a slew of exchanges.\nBlockchain analytics was used to bring these shady transactions to light — with Chainalysis revealing that both Binance and Tether cooperated with law enforcement by freezing funds so they could be seized by the Justice Department. In a statement provided to Chainalysis, Tether’s chief executive Paolo Ardoino said:\n“Tether is proud to proactively support global law enforcement efforts in combating the illicit use of stablecoins. The notion that criminals can use stablecoins to hide is simply false — every asset is on-chain, visible, and traceable in real time.”\nArdoino vowed that Tether “will continue to work proactively with authorities around the world to safeguard the integrity of the financial ecosystem.”\nChainalysis went on to add that it believes this operation will serve as an effective deterrent for terrorist organizations in the future.\nCrypto ‘Weak’ as a Terror Fundraising Tool\nBack in 2023 — just a couple of weeks after the October 7th attack — the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic stressed that the amounts terror groups are raising through cryptocurrency “remain tiny compared to other funding sources.”\nWhile Hamas was the first terrorist organization to start soliciting Bitcoin donations in 2019, both Israel and the U.S. have been engaged in aggressive efforts to seize funds — collaborating with exchanges to deactivate their accounts. Elliptic added:\n“This illustrates the weakness of crypto as a terrorism fundraising tool. The transparency of the blockchain allows illicit funds to be traced, and in some cases linked to real-world identities.”\nAt the time, Elliptic was responding to a Wall Street Journal report that had vastly overestimated the amount of crypto that Hamas had received — with a letter written by lawmakers inaccurately stating that more than $130 million had been raised by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from August 2021 to June 2023. It went on to warn:\n“Careful and detailed understanding of blockchain analysis is needed whenever approaching a nuanced and sensitive topic such as this, and the full context of any analysis should be provided by those using these insights.”\nClamping Down on Hamas\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, U.S. authorities have adopted a multi-pronged approach to make it prohibitively difficult for Hamas-linked entities to solicit crypto donations. This has included collaborating with other jurisdictions on sanctions, alerting financial institutions about this threat, and fining the trading platforms that have facilitated these transactions.\nBinance’s $4.4 billion fine for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act was directly related to how the exchange had failed to disclose suspicious transfers made by the likes of Hamas and North Korea . That also led to the shock resignation of Changpeng Zhao , with then treasury secretary Janet Yellen declaring:\n“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.”\nDespite the traceability of cryptocurrencies overall, malicious actors have found ways to launder digital assets, as seen following the Lazarus Group’s audacious hack of the Bybit exchange.\nGoing forward, law enforcement agencies and crypto firms alike will need to remain vigilant.",

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nSamson Mow , the CEO at JAN3, has shared his take on the current Bitcoin situation in the market as the world’s largest cryptocurrency keeps dropping and has lost 4.3% in the past two days.\nMow is also widely known for his frequent predictions that Bitcoin will reach $1 million per coin in the near future.\nBitcoin forming bear trap\nSamson Mow has described the current situation in the Bitcoin market as a “bear trap.” This trading signal shows up when an asset seems to be in a steady decline. Seeing it happening, traders often begin to short that asset as they expect it to decline further. However, what the price does instead is that it makes a sudden reverse and surges back up.\nA bear trap can usually form for several reasons — when the market sentiment shifts, due to manipulation coming from whales, or due to regulatory developments. Over the past two days, Bitcoin has lost more than 4% of its market value, plunging from the $87,500 zone down to $83,800, where it is changing hands at the moment. On Friday, BTC attempted to rise, gaining almost 1%, but then it was pulled back to where it started from.\nIf Mow proves right, Bitcoin should stage a harsh reverse soon, pushing upward and leaving short sellers counting losses on their trading accounts.\nThis asset can outperform Bitcoin briefly, per Kiyosaki\nFamous investor and the author of the classic book on finance management “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki has recently shared a tweet in which he named an asset he believes to be better than Bitcoin and gold for the next few months.\nKiyosaki is a well-known Bitcoin advocate. In his tweets, he frequently recommends that his followers accumulate BTC, claiming that it will make them rich in the future. However, before he started advocating Bitcoin, he recommended the same regarding gold and silver in their physical form — bullions, coins and so on.\nHowever, this week, Kiyosaki stated that he expects silver to be better than gold and Bitcoin for the next two months or so. He believes that silver will reach a new all-time high this year — $75 and then hit $200 in a year or two due to the rapidly rising industrial demand. Currently, silver is trading at $35 per ounce.",

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) could witness a rally soon, given the flashing signals of its technical indicators. If the market aligns with the signals from the Bollinger Bands, the bearish turbulence that the meme coin has faced may abate.\nSHIB finds support amid bearish pressure\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, within the last 24 hours, SHIB has plummeted from $0.00001332, crashing through several support levels before halting at $0.0000126, where the price reversed.\nAnalysts say the SHIB Bollinger Bands hold out hope for investors in the dog-themed meme coin.\nNotably, the upper and lower Bollinger bands tighten, reducing bearish pressure. From now on, the SHIB market could witness less volatility.\nFor clarity, SHIB's price currently lies in the middle, a level that ordinarily shows neutrality and could either break out or slump.\nHowever, for SHIB, this is teasing a potential bullish ride in the long term, as a token after retesting the lower band may rebound. Hence, analysts see a breakout ahead as they look forward to time unraveling the signs in the crypto market.\nCould Shiba Inu hit $0.00001520?\nSome predictions see SHIB soar to $0.00001520 if a breakout occurs, riding on strong bullish momentum. However, it would depend on buying momentum, such as renewed investor interest and an uptick in the deflationary mechanism.\nIn recent community support, the burn mechanism saw over 14 million SHIB sent to dead wallets. This is the ecosystem’s way of stabilizing prices via reduced circulating supply.\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu team has sparked optimism among investors as they prepare to launch Shib Finance, a DeFi platform that would create multiple utilities such as lending, borrowing and saving services.\nWhile the community awaits these developments, market participants anticipate a price recovery and rebound to higher levels.\nAs of this writing, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00001272, representing a 4.44% decline in the last 24 hours.",

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\nData shared by crypto trader and analyst Ali Martinez shows that cryptocurrency whales have shoveled a massive amount of Ethereum recently.\nWhales let go of 200,000 ETH\nThe analyst shared a chart provided by the on-chain data company CryptoQuant, showing that 200,000 ETH have changed hands over the past two weeks. That is the equivalent of roughly $376,122,553.\nThe chart shows the change in the balances of wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH. Judging by the curve, the whales have dumped 200,000 Ethereum as the balance dropped roughly from a total of 12.77 million to 12.57 million ETH.\n\"Ethereum back to $1,000?\" Bloomberg's Mike McGlone\nThis week, the chief commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, issued a post on his X account, reflecting whether the second most popular crypto coin, Ethereum, is likely to reverse to $1,000 as it happened in 2020 during the global lockdowns caused by the pandemic.\nMcGlone believes the market should pay attention to the Ethereum price trajectory now, since he sees a clear link between it and the prices of other risk assets in the market. Should ETH plunge further, the expert said, it would be indicative of a weakness of stocks on the S&P 500 index.\nEthereum struggling to recapture the $2,000 level “may guide the way for risk assets,” per him. He queried whether ETH would not manage this challenge and reverse the current trend, falling back to the $1,000 price level later this year. Should this happen, other top altcoins might follow in its footsteps, sliding into the red. Bitcoin unable to regain stable price growth may well add to that, pushing altcoin prices down.\nBitcoin might head back to $10,000, McGlone believes\nMcGlone seems to be bearish not only on Ethereum. Bloomberg’s strategist shared that the current Bitcoin market performance somehow mirrors the performance of the tech index Nasdaq 100 back in 2000 when the dot-com bubble collapsed. Back then, Nasdaq spiked to an all-time high of 5,000 points and then collapsed by roughly 80% when the bubble burst.\nThe same might happen to Bitcoin now, per McGlone, since investor sentiment has shifted and they are withdrawing funds from Bitcoin ETFs, putting them in gold ETFs. Following Bitcoin, S&P 500 might go down as well, he warns. He expects a BTC drop to $10,000 .",

The crypto market has been experiencing increased volatility, leading to increased trading interest in XRP.\nThe crypto market is currently trading in losses in the early Saturday session, extending Friday's slide, with the majority of digital assets down as investors considered a higher-than-expected inflation report.

This level is important since it could decide the next phase of XRP's price movement.\nAnalysts have recently spotted a classic head-and-shoulders pattern on the XRP price chart. The bearish pattern predicts a 55% drop for XRP if validated with a focus on $1.90 as support to hold and the $3 mark to invalidate the setup.\nAt the time of writing, XRP was down 6.54% in the last 24 hours to $2.06 and down 14% weekly. XRP has seen a drop since March 25 and will mark the fifth consecutive day of losses if today closes in red. Today's drop reached intraday lows of $2.06 at press time.\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt, in a recent tweet, reiterated his bearish outlook for XRP, citing the appearance of a classic complex head-and-shoulders top pattern. \"This could become bullish if 3.0 is exceeded; otherwise, the implication is a decline to 1.07,\" Brandt stated.\nA return above the daily SMA 50 at $2.41 might be necessary to initiate bullish action and force XRP out of its current range trading.

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T14:18:33+00:00",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Michael Egorov, Founder of Curve Finance .\nThe recent Bybit hack saw a grand total of $1.5 billion lost in crypto assets and has become the biggest hack in the entire history of this industry. The thing that makes this breach particularly concerning is that hackers targeted Bybit’s cold storage — typically the most secure part of an exchange’s infrastructure.\nWhile Bybit moved quickly to replenish its reserves with the help of partners, the whole event still left many people shaken up. This situation once again raises security concerns. How vulnerable are crypto exchanges and what lessons should the industry take from this breach?\nThe Growing Risk to CEX Platforms\nThe way I see it, this incident is more than just another attack — it’s a wake-up call exposing the systemic security flaws of centralized exchanges. Despite implementing strict security measures, CEX platforms remain prime targets for hackers. Why? Precisely because of their centralized nature.\nUnlike in DeFi, where user funds are distributed across self-custodial wallets, centralized platforms store assets in a controlled infrastructure. This creates a possibility of a single point of failure, where breaching a single layer of security can give attackers easy access to vast amounts of funds. After that, it’s pretty much over. Any recovery of funds has to rely on centralized oversight, assistance of external agents and sheer luck.\nChainalysis report clearly shows that in 2024, centralized services were the most targeted, marking a notable shift from DeFi hacks to CeFi. This is further confirmed by Hacken’s data that CeFi breaches more than doubled in the previous year, leading to the loss of almost $700 million. Access control vulnerabilities were highlighted among the primary causes of breaches.\nThis confirms that exchanges need to rethink their approach to security.\nDeFi’s Alternative Take on Asset Safety\nThe good thing about DeFi platforms is that their very nature minimizes the risks we covered above. Instead of relying on a centralized infrastructure, DeFi protocols leverage smart contracts and cryptographic security mechanisms to protect assets. This eliminates the possibility of centralized points of failure — there’s no single entity that can be exploited to drain user funds.\nHowever, it should be noted that DeFi isn’t without risks of its own. Since it operates in a permissionless environment, hackers are always present. And since transactions are irreversible, the only true protection is flawless code. Poorly written code can lead to vulnerabilities, but if there are no errors, then hackers can’t take advantage of them to break in.\nHacken’s 2024 security report indicates that smart contract exploits accounted for just 14% of crypto losses in 2024. This is why I believe that smart contract audits are essential to ensure the highest possible security standards.\nAI in Cybersecurity: A Double-Edged Sword\nSince artificial intelligence is becoming a more heated topic every day, there are many in the crypto market who wonder what role it will play in security. So I’m going to offer my two cents on the subject.\nFirst of all, AI tools have not yet been developed to the point where they would be effective in such tasks. But when they come around to that level, it is very likely that they will be effective.\nProperly developed AI tools can potentially be highly useful when it comes to simulating and analyzing the execution of smart contracts. In other words, they can help detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, allowing developers to patch security holes well before hackers come knocking.\nAutomated testing and AI-assisted audits can also significantly enhance security standards, making both DeFi and CeFi systems more robust. But it would be wise not to rely completely on artificial intelligence in such matters – even this tech can miss things.\nAt the same time, AI tools can also be weaponized by hackers to scan systems and identify flaws to exploit faster than ever before. This will inevitably mean an arms race between security teams and hackers where platforms will have to constantly stay one step ahead.\nAnd the one thing I would absolutely advise against is using AI to write the actual smart contracts. Given the current level of development of this technology, AI-written code cannot yet match human developers in quality or security.\nWhat Should Crypto Exchanges Do Next?\nBy now, all centralized exchanges implement industry best practices, such as multisignature wallets and other security protocols. However, as the Bybit hack has shown, these measures don’t seem to be enough on their own.\nCEXs inherently create centralized points of failure. While they should be highly secured, they remain single points of attack, making them attractive targets for hackers. One potential solution to this problem could be introducing user-controlled wallets with extra layers of oversight managed by the exchanges. However, it is also well-known that self-custody and key management is extremely inconvenient for most users. So that’s not a particularly safe approach.\nIn that case, what can exchanges do differently on their side of things?\nFirst of all, we need to recognize that many security mechanisms used by these platforms today, including multisignature wallets, rely on Web 2.0 technologies. This means that their security depends on not just how robust the smart contracts are, but also on the safety of web-based frontends. The UIs that users interact with and through which those smart contracts are accessed.\nIssues in frontend security can undermine the entire system, if hackers find a way to compromise it. But ensuring security here is a challenge and a half. Web applications often rely on thousands of dependencies (Uniswap’s UI, for example, has over 4,500), all of which represent a potential attack vector. If even one of these dependencies gets compromised, hackers could inject malicious code into the interface without ever needing to attack the core system.\nAs such, developers must ensure that not only their own code is safe but also every piece of software their platform depends on.\nA good solution would be for large exchanges to use self-hosted Web UIs. They do exist, including for the Safe wallet, in particular. An even better option would be to use specially designed software that bypasses traditional web technologies altogether when interacting with smart contracts. For example, there is an official CLI tool for Safe wallets, which significantly reduces the number of dependencies (by a factor of about 100), bringing down the risk of supply chain attacks.\nAdditionally, all signing for high-value transactions should be conducted on isolated machines used exclusively for this purpose and nothing else. Doing so minimizes the risk of the human factor playing a role in compromising the signing infrastructure with malware. Another approach could be leveraging containerized operating systems like QubesOS — they are quite exotic at the moment, but do offer enhanced security as part of their design philosophy.\nAnd, of course, while hardware wallets are the standard practice that everyone uses, when high-value transactions are involved, it is critical that exchanges implement mechanisms to verify what, exactly, these wallets are signing. Currently, hardware wallets do not make this task easy, but there are tools available in the market that can assist in verifying transaction data before execution.\nAll in all, implementing any of these measures is no simple feat — this is a truth that has to be acknowledged. Perhaps the industry as a whole needs to establish formalized security recommendations or even develop specialized operating systems tailored for safe interaction with crypto out of the box.\nBut it is also true that without significant upgrades to security infrastructure, the risks posed to CEXs will only continue to grow.",

At the same time, Ethereum is hovering at the $1,800 level. The global crypto market cap is now $2.71 trillion, down from last week’s $2.77 trillion.\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam , last week’s NFT sales volume stood at $100.9 million. This week’s figure represents a mild recovery for the sector.\nNFT buyers have increased dramatically by 28.9% to 451,436, while NFT sellers have grown by 26.5% to 285,272. However, NFT transactions have decreased by 2.8% to 1,614,680.\nEthereum maintains dominant position\nThe Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain maintains its dominant position with $32 million in sales, up 19.4% from last week.\nPolygon ( POL ) has secured the second position with $18.1 million in sales volume with a strong 33.1% increase. This pushes Solana ( SOL ) down in the rankings, as Solana’s sales have dropped by 4.4% to $8.7 million.\nMythos Chain ranks third with $13.7 million in sales, despite experiencing a 12.8% decrease from the previous week. Bitcoin ( BTC ) follows in fourth place with $10.1 million, with a 40.7% drop in NFT sales volume.\nEthereum continues to account for the majority of wash trading at $2.6 million, though this figure has decreased by 9.9% from the previous week.\nIn terms of collections, Courtyard on Polygon has taken the top spot with $15.7 million in sales and a 33.1% increase. DMarket has moved to second place with $8.5 million, down 18.3% from last week.\nCryptoPunks has seen the most notable growth, with sales surging by 141.4% to $6.3 million. This collection’s success is further highlighted by the top individual NFT sale of the week – CryptoPunks #2967 sold for 420 ETH ($843,070).\nGuild of Guardians Heroes ranks fourth with $5.5 million in sales, which is a slight decrease of 1.8%. Bitcoin’s BRC-20 NFTs round out the top five with $2.7 million in sales, down 19% from the previous week.\nOther notable high-value sales in the last seven days include:\nCryptoPunks #6935 sold for 135 ETH ($271,890)\n-\nCryptoPunks #3007 sold for 120 ETH ($239,342)\n-\nCryptoPunks #2301 sold for 115 ETH ($234,959)\n-\nAutoglyphs #364 sold for 105 ETH ($210,172)\n-",

        "title": "How to Spot Crypto Deepfakes",
        "published_time": "2025-03-29T16:59:54+00:00",
        "content": "How to Spot Crypto Deepfakes\nArtificial intelligence tools are getting increasingly powerful with every passing month, and that means the threat of deepfakes is intensifying.\nDoctored videos are often used to flog bogus crypto investment schemes, but they can also be weaponized for misinformation — spreading online like wildfire.\nA comically bad example of this came in recent days, after Fox News host Laura Ingraham interviewed Donald Trump at the White House.\nIt appeared to show the president pulling back curtains to proudly display a framed copy of Bitcoin’s whitepaper within the Oval Office.\nThe clip was accompanied by an amateurish graphic that screamed “TRUMP SHOWS LAURA THE BITCOIN WHITEPAPER” — as if to insinuate that the footage had actually been broadcast on television.\nTo be honest, it’s difficult to understand what the motivation for this particular deepfake was. There doesn’t seem to have been any financial motive — it might even have been intended as satire.\nYet posts like this underline a serious point: crypto enthusiasts need to be more vigilant than ever before, and question the posts they see online.\nSo… let’s take a quick look at some top tips for spotting deepfakes.\n1. Look Closely at the Face\nWhile AI models can produce some pretty convincing videos, they aren’t perfect. One of their weak spots is perfectly emulating human expressions.\nExperts at MIT say that — when you’re looking at footage of a person — scrutinize their cheeks and forehead to see whether they’re too smooth or wrinkly. Pay attention to whether they’re blinking too much… or too little. And focus on the lips too, as unnatural movement can indicate words are being put in their mouth.\n2. What Are They Saying?\nThis next tip links nicely to the red flags that indicate a crypto scam more generally. If you come across a video of Elon Musk or Michael Saylor and they appear to be endorsing an investment opportunity, ask yourself this: would they really appear in a clip making too-good-to-be-true promises?\nAccording to staggering research from McAfee, the average American comes across almost three deepfake videos a day . To make matters worse, there’s a growing trend of hackers overtaking the X accounts of celebrities to shill tokens.\n3. Examine the Source\nIf you’re still pretty convinced that a deepfake video could be legitimate, it’s worth doing some research to see whether the claims stack up.\nTypically speaking, a significant video from a notable crypto figure will have attracted coverage from a site like Cryptonews . Check out whether journalists have been able to verify whether this footage is real.\nA lack of articles backing up the clip’s content will indicate that it’s bogus.\n4. Check the Comments\nCommunities on X and Facebook can be pretty good at flagging whenever a deepfake video is doing the rounds — through systems such as “Community Notes.” But sometimes, it can take a few hours for warnings to appear.\nA good back-up plan is to check the comments underneath a clip, as users will often call out when AI has been used for malicious purposes.\n5. Take Extra Care with Audio\nWhile deepfake videos offer certain visual clues that indicate something’s amiss, detecting manipulated audio can be pretty difficult.\nTop tips here include scrutinizing the tone of someone’s voice — do they sound flatter, less emotive and less conversational than they usually would?\nAI-generated audio often removes breathing noises in between sentences, which sounds incredibly unnatural. There might also be no background noise whatsoever — or too much.\nThe Stakes Are High\nIt’s crucial to raise awareness about the warning signs surrounding deepfakes.\nOne man who saw a manipulated video of a British celebrity ended up losing $35,000 after being tricked into putting his savings into a bogus crypto exchange.\nMartin Lewis, a journalist who’s gained a reputation for being a “money saving expert,” described the rise of these clips as “frightening” — and called for regulators and the government to take swift action to protect the public.\nCrypto businesses can also end up being vulnerable. Hackers managed to target a number of projects by pretending to be Binance’s former chief strategy officer Patrick Hillman.\nDeepfakes have also been used to impersonate a number of other high-profile executives, often by drawing on footage from their past television interviews and conference appearances.",

        "title": "GRASS Surges 30% In a Week With Indicators Suggesting Further Gains",
        "published_time": "2025-03-29T16:30:00+00:00",
        "content": "GRASS has surged nearly 30% over the past week, with its market cap climbing back to $415 million and its price breaking above $1.70 for the first time since March 10.\nThis strong performance has been backed by bullish technical signals, including a consistently positive BBTrend and a rising ADX. However, with momentum indicators beginning to cool slightly, the next few days will be key in determining whether GRASS continues its rally or enters a period of consolidation.\nGRASS BBTrend Remains Strong, But Is Slightly Declining\nGRASS’s BBTrend is currently at 11.28, marking the fourth consecutive day in positive territory, after peaking at 14.85 two days ago.\nThe BBTrend (Bollinger Band Trend) indicator measures the strength of price trends by analyzing how far the price moves away from its moving average within Bollinger Bands.\nGenerally, values above zero indicate an uptrend, while values below zero suggest a downtrend. The higher the positive reading, the stronger the bullish momentum , whereas deep negative values reflect strong selling pressure.\nWith GRASS maintaining a BBTrend of 11.28, the token is still in an active uptrend, although slightly cooler than its recent peak.\nSustained positive BBTrend readings typically signal that buyers remain in control and that upward momentum could continue.\nHowever, the slight pullback from 14.85 might suggest that momentum is starting to ease. If the BBTrend begins to decline further, it could be an early sign of consolidation or a possible reversal.\nFor now, GRASS appears to be holding onto bullish momentum , but traders should monitor any shifts in trend strength closely.\nGRASS ADX Shows The Uptrend Is Getting Stronger\nGRASS is currently in an uptrend, with its Average Directional Index (ADX) rising to 30.31 from 26.49 just a day ago, indicating a strengthening trend momentum .\nThe ADX is a widely used technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction, on a scale from 0 to 100.\nValues below 20 suggest a weak or non-existent trend, while readings above 25 indicate that a trend is gaining traction.\nWhen the ADX moves above 30, it typically signals that the trend is becoming well-established and may continue in the same direction.\nWith GRASS’s ADX now above the 30 threshold, the current uptrend appears to be gaining strength. This suggests that bullish momentum is firming up and that price action may continue favoring the upside in the near term.\nAs long as the ADX remains elevated or continues climbing, the trend is likely to sustain, attracting more interest from momentum traders.\nHowever, if the ADX begins to plateau or reverse, it could signal a potential slowdown or consolidation phase ahead .\nGRASS Could Form A New Golden Cross Soon\nGRASS’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are showing signs of a potential golden cross, a bullish signal that occurs when a short-term EMA crosses above a long-term one.\nIf this crossover confirms, it could mark the beginning of a sustained uptrend. GRASS is likely to test the immediate resistance at $1.85 as some artificial intelligence coins start to recover good momentum.\nShould bullish momentum from the past week persist, the token may push even higher toward $2.26 and eventually $2.56 or $2.79, possibly solidifying its position as one of the best-performing altcoins in the market .\nHowever, if the trend fails to hold and sentiment shifts bearish, GRASS could pull back to retest the support at $1.63.\nA break below this level might open the door to a deeper correction, potentially driving the price down to $1.22.\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\nSolana’s volatility drives investors to a new crypto project, rumored to have 12,000% growth potential in the current bull run.\nTable of Contents\nRecent turbulence in the Solana market has sparked conversations about potential new opportunities in the crypto world. Investors are turning their attention to a newly emerging cryptocurrency that promises substantial returns, with some speculating it could rise as much as 12,000%. As the current bull market gains momentum, this new coin is capturing the attention of those seeking to ride the next big wave in digital assets.\nCatzilla: The memecoin movement has arrived\nGreed? Shattered.\nMarket manipulation? Challenged.\nScammers? Sent packing.\nCatzilla (CATZILLA) isn’t here to play nice — it’s crashing into DeFi like a digital kaiju, tearing down corrupt systems and creating a playground of possibilities for crypto lovers, meme warriors, and forward-thinking investors.\nNot just another flash-in-the-pan project\nWhile most memecoins promise the moon and vanish before liftoff, Catzilla is built to last. Its 14-stage presale is already turning heads — starting at just $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016, giving early adopters a massive 88% discount on entry. This isn’t hype without substance— it’s a calculated climb designed for serious long-term potential.\nThree powerful utilities in one fierce token\nCATZILLA isn’t just for fun — it’s built for function:\nGovernance – Community-driven decision making\n-\nIncentives – Get rewarded for supporting the ecosystem\n-\nStaking – Hold and earn with passive income opportunities\n-\nThis triple-threat model transforms CATZILLA from a simple meme token into a full-fledged financial tool for a new generation of investors.\nA movement, not just a meme\nCatzilla is rallying a diverse community — from seasoned DeFi explorers to anime and gaming fans who love the kaiju aesthetic. It’s a space where creativity meets capital, and where every participant has a voice in shaping what comes next.\nFinal roar: Is this the next 12,000% play?\nSolana may be slipping, but the crypto story is far from over. Catzilla is offering more than just a rebound — it’s offering a rebellion. A chance to join a mission that values transparency, community, and real utility in a meme-powered package.\nGrab CATZILLA now and be part of the most entertaining, rewarding, and rebellious movement in crypto.\nIntroduction to SOL and its role in the Solana ecosystem\nSolana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability. It supports decentralized applications and competes with platforms like Ethereum. It emphasizes quick transactions and wide development support. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is essential to its system. SOL facilitates transactions and powers various programs. It rewards users who support the network.\nThe Solana ecosystem relies on SOL to operate and support projects. Solana differs from other platforms by not using sharding or second-layer solutions for scaling. This makes it appealing to developers and investors seeking robust network capacity. The platform’s unique approach and growing ecosystem give SOL potential appeal in the market. Its focus on high-speed and scalability hints at promising use cases as blockchain adoption grows.\nConclusion\nWhile coins like SOL may show less potential in the short term, Catzilla emerges as a standout in the current bull run. Positioned as the ultimate meme coin hero, Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone, offering a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale. With its triple utility — governance, incentives, and staking options — it invites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights.\nFor more information on Catzilla, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram Chat .\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "published_time": "2025-03-29T20:03:00+00:00",
        "content": "Trump pardons BitMEX founders, is ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver next?\nVitalik Buterin, Ross Ulbricht, and Tucker Carlson are among those urging President Donald Trump to pardon Roger Ver, aka Bitcoin Jesus.\nKnown as Bitcoin Jesus for his early advocacy of Bitcoin, Ver faces up to 109 years in prison on tax charges, including allegations of evading $48 million in taxes. Despite renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014 to avoid prosecution, Ver’s legal troubles resurfaced when he was arrested in Spain in 2024. But following the president’s earlier pardons of figures like Ulbricht and BitMEX co-founders, observers wonder whether Ver’s would catch a break. Is a pardon on the way, or will Ver’s legal troubles continue?\nRead on for a closer look.\nTable of Contents\nCrypto cronies\nAfter Trump embraced cryptocurrency, many crypto leaders rallied to support him by donating funds to his inauguration and hobnobbing at galas.\nTrump also , which industry brass celebrated.\nIn return, Trump signed an order to stockpile tokens and swiftly acted in favor of the industry. Under Trump-appointed SEC chair Mark Uyeda, investigations into several cryptocurrency companies, including Immutable, Crypto.com, Ripple, and Coinbase, were dismissed.\nIn a notable move on Thursday, March 27, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, who had pleaded guilty to federal charges related to money laundering and regulatory violations. The trio was convicted for failing to implement anti-money laundering measures at BitMEX, which prosecutors had labeled a “money laundering platform.” Reed had also violated the Bank Secrecy Act and paid a $10 million fine. But under Trump, it seems all is forgiven.\nThis has sparked speculation on whether Ver, a prominent figure in the crypto world, could also receive the same courtesy.\nVer, a Silicon Valley native with a libertarian streak, was deeply involved in the early days of cryptocurrency, investing in companies like Kraken, Ripple, and Blockchain.com. In 2017, Ver hyped Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) as more suitable for everyday payments.\nVer’s past\nIn 2000, by the age of 20, Ver began to participate in libertarian party debates.\nDuring these debates, he made critical statements about the agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, calling them “murderers” and referencing their involvement in the scandalous Waco Siege in which dozens of children were killed in a standoff between FBI and ATF agents and Branch Davidian cult followers. Ver didn’t know that ATF agents were present during these debates.\nIn the 2000s, Ver became involved in e-commerce. On top of tech enterprises, Ver was selling firecrackers on eBay. After selling unlicensed firecrackers in 2001, he was charged and spent 10 months in prison. The fact that he was locked in jail instead of being fined or notified about the necessity of obtaining a license led Ver to think that the case was politically motivated and that his criticism of ATF was the real reason behind his prosecution. Without fear of further persecution, Ver left the U.S. after his post-prison probation ended.\nBy 2011, Ver learned about Bitcoin and became one of its first investors. He also advocated for Bitcoin long before it went mainstream, with multi-million investments and national leaders talking about its importance for the future of their countries.\nThe key points of Ver’s advocacy for Bitcoin were the financial freedom of individuals and the stopping of government and banks from interfering in people’s lives.\nThe legal fight\nSince February 2014, Ver has been a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis. He claims that he had to renounce his U.S. citizenship after long-lasting targeting from the U.S. government.\nIn April 2024, he was indicted and arrested in Spain on charges of U.S. tax evasion and mail fraud. Ver is accused of dodging $48 million in taxes after earning up to half a billion dollars through cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to prosecutors, Ver failed to pay his “exit tax” on 131,000 BTC owned by his two companies when he left the U.S. and provided false info to the law firms filing Ver’s tax returns. Allegedly , he sold his bitcoins in 2017 without notifying the financial attorneys.\nVer clarifies that three charges of mail fraud (combined, punishable by 19 years behind bars) are based on the three letters with his tax returns he sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nVer denies he committed crimes such as tax evasion and mail fraud. He insists he was doing his best to comply with the nascent Bitcoin taxation rules, and that his prosecution was politically motivated.\nIn December, he began his legal fight against the prosecution, denying all the charges. He filed a motion to dismiss charges, but the government rejected it in January.\nVer’s legal team challenged an exit tax as “an unconstitutional burden on the fundamental right to expatriate.” For people like Ver, who have substantial amounts of low-liquidity assets, the exit tax may be prohibitive. The government suggests Ver is a fugitive. He disagrees with this status as he doesn’t hide and didn’t commit crimes for which he is judged while living in the U.S.\nOn March 1, Ethereum’s Buterin published an X post arguing that the exit tax doesn’t exist in most other countries and called it the “tax-by-citizenship” and “extreme.”\nIn addition, Buterin mentioned that the IRS obtained some of the information by intimidating Ver’s lawyers. The Ethereum founder added:\n“Genuine good faith mistakes should be treated by giving the actor the opportunity to pay back taxes if needed with interest and penalties, not with prosecution.”\nWill Bitcoin Jesus be pardoned?\nTrump promised to pardon Ross Ulbricht if get elected. Ulbricht, the man behind the Silk Road marketplace charged for money laundering and drug trafficking, is an important figure in the history of Bitcoin as his marketplace drove Bitcoin’s adoption. After the inauguration, Trump indeed pardoned Ulbricht to much acclaim.\nSoon, various crypto advocates began to urge Trump to pardon Roger Ver. On Jan. 21, 2025, following the pardon of Ross Ulbricht, an X influencer using the moniker Rothmus published a short post calling for the pardon of Ver to which Elon Musk replied : “will inquire.” This reply gave the community hope for the pardon of Bitcoin Jesus.\nOn March 17, Marla Maples, Trump’s ex-wife, took to X to share a touching video where people who met Ver tell their stories of his generosity.\nIt is not clear, though, if the POTUS paid attention to this post.\nThe hope for a pardon of Ver was seriously undermined on Jan. 26, when Elon Musk suddenly, via an X post, stated that Ver would not be pardoned because he gave up his U.S. citizenship.\nThe statement drew much criticism, as Musk is not an elected official and cannot decide who to pardon and who not to. He is, however, Trump’s advisor and was a major donor to his “MAGA” campaign.\nMore than that, the POTUS is not prohibited from pardoning non-U.S. citizens. Finally, many commented that Ver had to renounce his citizenship under pressure from ATF and a U.S. prison sentence.\nA few hours after Musk’s tweet, Ver took X to post a video in which he briefly explained why he was prosecuted and asked Trump for a pardon.\nIn the video, Ver stated that he is American and that renouncing his citizenship was one of the “hardest and saddest decisions [he] ever made.”\nAfter Ulbricht, Hayes, Delo, and Reed received presidential pardons, others, including Angela McArdle, who currently serves as Chair of the national Libertarian Party, called for freeing Ver as well.\n“Let’s pray Roger Ver is next!” she declared on Friday.\nIt remains to be seen whether Musk made skeptical comments over the possibility of Ver’s clemency on Trump’s behalf or if it was only his view of the situation.\nAt last check Saturday, Trump hasn’t commented on Ver’s situation.",

        "content": "Jump into the final Africa crypto week in review for March and discover as Quidax and Tether form a new crypto Africa partnership for crypto education. Meanwhile, mainstream media eyes are on Zambia Bitcoin mining operations powering rural areas, as Binance Nigeria news dominates the headlines.\nThe last week of March closes with its fair share of crypto developments on the African continent. Crypto exchange Quidax is partnering with Tether to launch educational efforts on the continent. In Zambia, a crypto mining startup harnesses cheap hydroelectricity to help power a local community, while Nigerian authorities have reignited their crackdown on Binance.\nAfrica Crypto News: Quidax and Tether For Crypto Education and Blockchain Awareness\nAfrican exchange Quidax and global stablecoin powerhouse Tether are partnering to boost crypto education efforts on the continent.\nThe joint effort aims to raise awareness of blockchain and stablecoins, starting with Nigeria and Ghana.\nThis initiative aims to empower approximately 15,000 people to leverage the digital asset age. As part of the program, financial literacy campaigns, thought leadership drives, interactive workshops, and similar initiatives will be conducted across the region and eventually continent-wide.\nTether benefits from increased stablecoin usage, as its USDT is key in global crypto trading, allowing users to buy some of the best cryptos in 2025 . Similarly, Quidax looks to expand its user base by creating thousands more crypto users through this effort.\nZambia Crypto News: Bitcoin Mining To Power Rural Homes\nThe BBC recently reported on a fascinating story of Bitcoin mining deep in rural Zambia near the DRC border.\nEntrepreneur Phillip Walton is harnessing the waters of the mighty Zambezi to mine Bitcoin at a low cost and sustainably.\nThe need for Bitcoin mining energy has boosted power demand.\nAccordingly, the local grid can now generate enough power to support 15,000 residents in the area. The uptake is still low because of infrastructure costs for local communities.\nStill, Bitcoin mining has made the setup financially viable for grid operators.\nThe revenue from Bitcoin mining ensures that grid operators can meet operational costs and, in turn, supply cheap power to the surrounding areas.\nBitcoin mining has gotten a bad rap over the years for its power consumption. However, this is an excellent win-win decentralized power arrangement for miners and the local community.\nNigeria Crypto News: Crackdown on Binance, Again?\nWhen the Nigeria crypto community thought things were improving, authorities reiterated their issues with Binance.\nThe mega-exchange was forced to exit the Nigerian market last year after a crackdown that saw the arrest of a senior executive.\nAuthorities now allege that Binance is helping fund criminal groups in the country through illicit financing. This allegation escalates the tax evasion claims that were floated last year. Nigerian authorities also want Nadeem Anjarwalla to be booked for escaping custody.\n( BNBUSDT )\nBinance, from where you can trade some of the best Solana meme coins , has denied these allegations, but it shows that the Nigerian market will not be easy to land.\nProgress had been made in the latter half of last year, with the executive released and Nigeria creating a more certain regulatory climate for blockchain firms in the region.\nNigeria remains a massive market, owing to its 200-million-strong population and youthful demographic.\nBinance and other operators must now brace for stricter measures or discussions with authorities on how best to handle the fallout. These developments will be fascinating to track.\nDISCOVER: 9 High-Risk High-Reward Cryptos for 2025\nAfrica Crypto News: Quidax Tether Education Push, Zambia Bitcoin Mining, Binance Nigeria News\nQuidax and Tether launch crypto education in Nigeria and Ghana to boost blockchain awareness\n-\nBitcoin Mining in Zambia powers 15,000 homes.
