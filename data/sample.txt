The Bybit hack has proven that communities can work together on a single mission. The Lazarus Group disrupted the trading platform when it laundered a total of 401,346 ETH stolen, valued at approximately $1.4 billion. Despite the mild retracement recorded over the weekend, negative sell pressure remains in the market. However, the sentiment in the market now is beyond the Bybit hack. The exchange said it has fully replenished its Ethereum reserve and fulfilled all usersâ€™ withdrawals. Though the funds came from loans from industry partners and OTC purchases, it has helped Bybit withstand an unusual bank run that saw exchanges like FTX declare bankruptcy. The unity in the market has further placed the broader industry in a positive light, thus showing that the current price action will likely not last for long.
