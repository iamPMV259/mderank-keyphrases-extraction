Read More Bitcoin has slipped to $82,516.97 , down 1.55% in 24 hours , triggering concerns of a deeper correction . But according to Samson Mow  , this breakdown is a “bear trap”—a fakeout designed to flush out weak hands before a larger move higher. Mow remains firm on his $1 million BTC target , arguing the recent sell-off doesn’t reflect fundamentals . Bitcoin still holds a $1.64 trillion market cap , with 19.84 million BTC in circulation. While Mow sees upside ahead , charts tell a different story . BTC has broken below a symmetrical triangle , with the former support at $83,650 now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Technical Setup Signals Caution The recent breakdown from the symmetrical triangle pattern has turned $83,650 into a key resistance zone , stalling any immediate rebound . A bearish engulfing candle under this level signals continued selling pressure. Current Price : $82,516.97 - 24H Volume : $19.93B - Resistance Levels : $83,650 , $85,231 , $86,841 - Support Levels : $82,000 , $81,278 , $79,990 - 50 EMA : $85,231 (above current price) - RSI (14) : 27.63 (oversold) - The RSI remains oversold , but without bullish divergence , offering no clear sign of reversal . A breakdown through the triple bottom around $83,000 further weakens the structure , placing $81,278 and $79,990 in view . Volume near current levels is also subdued , reflecting a lack of strong buyer support. What Comes Next for Bitcoin? The key question is whether this is the trap Mow describes , or the start of a broader correction . Broader sentiment is mixed , with macroeconomic pressure and tight liquidity weighing on high-risk assets. A confirmed reclaim of $83,650 , followed by a breakout above the 50 EMA at $85,231 , would be an early signal of bullish recovery . Otherwise , continued failure at current levels risks a slide below $80,000. Key Signals to Monitor: Break and close above $83,650 - RSI divergence or recovery above 30 - Trading volume increase on bounce attempts - Support holding at $81,278 or $79,990 - Until these conditions are met , Bitcoin remains vulnerable . Whether Samson Mow’s call plays out will depend on how markets respond in the days ahead.
