One important problem in grid computing is resource selection , that is , finding an appropriate resource set for the application . Another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid environment . Existing solutions to these two problems require that a performance model for an application is known . However , constructing such models is a complex task . In this paper , we investigate an approach that does not require performance models . We start an application on any set of resources . During the application run , we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and deduce application requirements from these statistics . Then , we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs . This approach allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks , such as overloaded WAN links or very slow processors , and therefore can yield significant performance improvements .

Large scale publish/subscribe systems are likely to employ components of the event transport network owned by cooperating , but independent organisations . As the number of participants in the network increases , security becomes an increasing concern . This paper extends previous work to present and evaluate a secure multi-domain publish/subscribe infrastructure that supports and enforces fine-grained access control over the individual attributes of event types . Key refresh allows us to ensure forward and backward security when event brokers join and leave the network . We demonstrate that the time and space overheads can be minimised by careful consideration of encryption techniques , and by the use of caching to decrease unnecessary decryptions .

They are filled with autonomous , mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users . To make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible , they are usually built on a client-server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub-worlds . In each sub-world , the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint , rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium . In such systems , the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user\"s viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability . Specifically , performing real-time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting . We recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem , and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query . Unfortunately , existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments . The main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real-time visibility determination . We then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality , system throughput , and resource utilization . We expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next-generation virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web-based services in the near future.\n++++++ label:  ['dynamic virtual environment', 'mutable virtual content', 'real-time visibility test', '3d object stream', 'object pop problem', 'object popping', 'visibility model', 'game-based application', 'object-initiated view model', 'spatial database', 'edge indexing', 'spatial index', '3d spatial extension', 'spatial indexing method']\n++++++ model: ['user', 'spatial indexing methods', 'game-based application systems such', 'objects', 'next-generation virtual frameworks', 'index structure', 'virtual environments', 'efficient spatial index structure', 'spatial database', 'scalable real-time visibility determination', 'real-time visibility tests', 'dynamic virtual environments', 'real-time', 'grid subspace division', 'spatial database problem']\n****  21  --->  0   9.523809523809524   7.692307692307692\nThe convergence of advances in storage , encoding , and networking technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged between network enabled devices . Keeping track of (or managing) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data . Storing live continuous media (such as TV or radio content) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with . Networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network , making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system . In this paper we present the design and implementation of the Spectrum content management system , which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment . Spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand-alone and various networked scenarios . A unique aspect of Spectrum is that it requires one (or more) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system . This means that there are no eviction policies . Content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system . Different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication . This approach also allows Spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media , to content . We not only describe the details of the Spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases.\n++++++ label:  ['network enabled dvr', 'policy manager', 'uniform resource locator', 'spectrum content management system', 'distribute content management', 'carrier-grade spectrum manager', 'high-performance database system', 'continuous media storage', 'application program interface', 'home-networking scenario', 'content distribution network']\n++++++ model: ['content', 'live continuous media', 'spectrum', 'content management system', 'network', 'spectrum content management system', 'content management', 'retention policies', 'various networked scenarios', 'system', 'policies', 'storage', 'typical use cases', 'rich media content', 'different retention policies']\n****  22  --->  14.814814814814815   12.500000000000002   16.216216216216214\n****  23  --->  0   0   0\nWhile market-based systems have long been proposed as solutions for distributed resource allocation , few have been deployed for production use in real computer systems .

We describe a user study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the previously proposed suggestion of related queries , as well as with traditional , unaided Web search .

A set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely unsupervised manner . The document frequency of each word across time is treated like a time series , where each element is the document frequency - inverse document frequency (DFIDF) score at one time point . In this paper , we 1) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics: important and less-reported , periodic and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with Gaussian density and periodic features with Gaussian mixture densities , and subsequently detected each feature\"s burst by the truncated Gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events .

Motivated by the needs of search advertising , we primarily focus on rare queries , which are the hardest from the point of view of machine learning , yet in aggregation account for a considerable fraction of search engine traffic .

Studies in literature have found many contextual factors that strongly influence the interpretation of a query . Recent studies have tried to consider the user\"s interests by creating a user profile . However , a single profile for a user may not be sufficient for a variety of queries of the user . In this study , we propose to use query-specific contexts instead of user-centric ones , including context around query and context within query . The former specifies the environment of a query such as the domain of interest , while the latter refers to context words within the query , which is particularly useful for the selection of relevant term relations .

A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user , or a user with little feedback , by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model . Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive . The commonly used EM algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in IR applications .

While these judgments are very useful for a one-time evaluation , it is not clear that they can be trusted when re-used to evaluate new systems . In this work , we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments . We then present a method for augmenting a set of relevance judgments with relevance estimates that require no additional assessor effort . Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems , we can reliably evaluate a larger set of ten systems .

Clustering search results is an effective way to organize search results , which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly . However , two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the user\"s perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster . In this paper , we propose to address these two deficiencies by (1) learning interesting aspects of a topic from Web search logs and organizing search results accordingly; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past query words entered by users .

In these approaches , agents depend on the content similarity between incoming queries and their direct neighboring agents to direct the distributed search sessions . However , such a heuristic is myopic in that the neighboring agents may not be connected to more relevant agents . In this paper , an online reinforcement-learning based approach is developed to take advantage of the dynamic run-time characteristics of P2P IR systems as represented by information about past search sessions . Specifically , agents maintain estimates on the downstream agents\" abilities to provide relevant documents for incoming queries . These estimates are updated gradually by learning from the feedback information returned from previous search sessions . Based on this information , the agents derive corresponding routing policies . Thereafter , these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the estimates based on the new routing policies . Experimental results demonstrate that the learning algorithm improves considerably the routing performance on two test collection sets that have been used in a variety of distributed IR studies.\n++++++ label:  ['peer-to-peer information retrieval', 'distributed search algorithm', 'reinforcement learning', 'distribute search control', 'routing decision', 'routing policy', 'learning algorithm', 'utility', 'peer-to-peer information retrieval system', 'query', 'multi-agent learn', 'network']\n++++++ model: ['ir', 'agents', 'search sessions', 'queries', 'information', 'dynamic run-time characteristics', 'p2p ir systems', 'distributed ir studies', 'policies', 'p2p', 'new routing policies', 'neighboring agents', 'approach', 'past search sessions', 'previous search sessions']\n****  55  --->  0   0   0\nFinding the right agents in a large and dynamic network to provide the needed resources in a timely fashion , is a long standing problem .

We first consider a model where all other bidders are local and participate in a single auction . For this case , we prove that , assuming free disposal , the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions , irrespective of the local bidders\" valuation distribution . Furthermore , for non-decreasing valuation distributions , we prove that the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to two dimensions . These results hold both in the case where the number of local bidders is known and when this number is determined by a Poisson distribution . This analysis extends to online markets where , typically , auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially . In addition , by combining analytical and simulation results , we demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global bidders , provided that the market consists of both global and local bidders . Finally , we address the efficiency of the overall market , and show that information about the number of local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which a global bidder affects efficiency.\n++++++ label:  ['global bidding agent', 'online market', 'social and behavioral science', 'perfect substitute', 'simultaneous auction', 'simultaneous second-price auction', 'utilitymaximising strategy', 'optimal bidding strategy', 'vickrey auction', 'non-decreasing valuation distribution', 'multiagent system', 'market efficiency']\n++++++ model: ['global bidder', 'local bidders', 'global', 'valuation distribution', 'local', 'several global bidders', 'number', 'simultaneous second-price auctions', 'market', 'auctions', 'non-decreasing valuation distributions', 'case', 'global bidding agent', 'results', 'optimal bidding strategies']\n****  59  --->  10.526315789473681   8.333333333333332   13.793103448275861\n****  60  --->  0   0   0\nWe investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents .

We analyze the dynamics which drive the agents\" strategies towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use for the two-sided parallel economic search model .

We assume a team of collaborative agents , each responsible for executing a portion of a globally pre-established schedule , but none possessing a global view of either the problem or solution . The goal is to maximize the joint quality obtained from the activities executed by all agents , given that , during execution , unexpected events will force changes to some prescribed activities and reduce the utility of executing others . We describe an agent architecture for solving this problem that couples two basic mechanisms: (1) a flexible times representation of the agent\"s schedule (using a Simple Temporal Network) and (2) an incremental rescheduling procedure . The former hedges against temporal uncertainty by allowing execution to proceed from a set of feasible solutions , and the latter acts to revise the agent\"s schedule when execution is forced outside of this set of solutions or when execution events reduce the expected value of this feasible solution set . Basic coordination with other agents is achieved simply by communicating schedule changes to those agents with inter-dependent activities . Then , as time permits , the core local problem solving infra-structure is used to drive an inter-agent option generation and query process , aimed at identifying opportunities for solution improvement through joint change .

With an explicit account of norms , openness in virtual organizations can be achieved: new components , designed by various parties , can be seamlessly accommodated . We focus on virtual organizations realised as multi-agent systems , in which human and software agents interact to achieve individual and global goals . However , any realistic account of norms should address their dynamic nature: norms will change as agents interact with each other and their environment . Due to the changing nature of norms or due to norms stemming from different virtual organizations , there will be situations when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited , that is , a conflict arises . Likewise , there will be situations when an action is both obliged and prohibited , that is , an inconsistency arises . We introduce an approach , based on first-order unification , to detect and resolve such conflicts and inconsistencies . In our proposed solution , we annotate a norm with the set of values their variables should not have in order to avoid a conflict or an inconsistency with another norm . Our approach neatly accommodates the domain-dependent interrelations among actions and the indirect conflicts/inconsistencies these may cause . More generally , we can capture a useful notion of inter-agent (and inter-role) delegation of actions and norms associated to them , and use it to address conflicts/inconsistencies caused by action delegation .

Based on the idea of providing alternative semantic variants for speech acts and transition rules between them that are contingent on previous agent behaviour , our framework provides an improved notion of grounding semantics in ongoing interaction , a simple mechanism for distinguishing between compliant and expected behaviour , and a way to specify sanction and reward mechanisms as part of the ACL itself .

A crucial aspect of the development of such methods is the notion of commitments , which provides a mechanism for coordinating interactive behaviors among agents . In this paper , we investigate an approach to model commitments with tight integration with protocol actions . This means that there is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols actions to operations on commitments and an external mechanism to process and enforce commitments . We show how agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning system based on temporal linear logic , which incorporates both temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning .

It is well known [15] that it is impossible for a mechanism to maximize social welfare whilst also being IR , IC , and BB . There have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by trading welfare for BB , e.g. , in domains such as double-sided auctions[13] , distributed markets[3] and supply chain problems[2 , 4] . In this paper we provide a procedure called a Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR) for single-value players , which given an IR and IC mechanism , outputs a mechanism which is IR , IC and BB with a loss of welfare . We bound the welfare achieved by our procedure for a wide range of domains . In particular , our results improve on existing solutions for problems such as double sided markets with homogenous goods , distributed markets and several kinds of supply chains . Furthermore , our solution provides budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed markets with strategic transportation edges.\n++++++ label:  ['budget-balanced mechanism', 'inequality in welfare', 'external competition', 'homogeneous good', 'multi-minded player', 'efficiency', 'generalized trade reduction', 'player power', 'internal competition', 'optimality', 'budget balance', 'gtr', 'power of player', 'spatially distributed market', 'trade reduction']\n++++++ model: ['ic', 'ir', 'double-sided auctions', 'several open problems such', ']', 'bb', '[', 'problems such', 'mechanism', 'budget balance', 'combinatorial double-sided auctions', 'welfare', 'such', 'strategic transportation edges', 'supply chain problems']\n****  76  --->  0   0   0\nOnline reviews have become increasingly popular as a way to judge the quality of various products and services . Previous work has demonstrated that contradictory reporting and underlying user biases make judging the true worth of a service difficult . In this paper , we investigate underlying factors that influence user behavior when reporting feedback . We look at two sources of information besides numerical ratings: linguistic evidence from the textual comment accompanying a review , and patterns in the time sequence of reports . We first show that groups of users who amply discuss a certain feature are more likely to agree on a common rating for that feature . Second , we show that a user\"s rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality as inferred from previous reviews . Both give us a less noisy way to produce rating estimates and reveal the reasons behind user bias .

Typically , not all buyers and sellers have access to the same intermediaries , and they trade at correspondingly different prices that reflect their relative amounts of power in the market . We model this phenomenon using a game in which buyers , sellers , and traders engage in trade on a graph that represents the access each buyer and seller has to the traders . In this model , traders set prices strategically , and then buyers and sellers react to the prices they are offered . We show that the resulting game always has a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium , and that all equilibria lead to an efficient (i.e . socially optimal) allocation of goods . We extend these results to a more general type of matching market , such as one finds in the matching of job applicants and employers . Finally , we consider how the profits obtained by the traders depend on the underlying graph - roughly , a trader can command a positive profit if and only if it has an essential connection in the network structure , thus providing a graph-theoretic basis for quantifying the amount of competition among traders . Our work differs from recent studies of how price is affected by network structure through our modeling of price-setting as a strategic activity carried out by a subset of agents in the system , rather than studying prices set via competitive equilibrium or by a truthful mechanism.\n++++++ label:  ['initial endowment of money', 'bid price', 'economics and finance', 'maximum and minimum amount', 'market', 'perfect competition', 'algorithmic game theory', 'interaction of buyer and seller', 'trader strategic behavior', 'benefit', 'strategic behavior of trader', 'monopoly', 'trade network', 'buyer and seller interaction', 'trading network', 'money initial endowment', 'complementary slackness']\n++++++ model: ['price', 'trade', 'buyer', 'trader', 'seller', 'traders', 'prices', 'subgame perfect nash equilibrium', 'sellers', 'buyers', 'network structure', 'market', 'model', 'game', 'graph']\n****  78  --->  21.052631578947363   16.666666666666664   20.689655172413794\n****  79  --->  0   17.391304347826086   21.42857142857143\nThis paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in graphical games . Our approach is based on the data structure called the best response policy , which was proposed by Kearns et al . [13] as a way to represent all Nash equilibria of a graphical game . In [9] , it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as long as the underlying graph is a path . In this paper , we show that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient algorithm which constructs a Nash equilibrium that guarantees certain payoffs to all participants . Another attractive solution concept is a Nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare . We show that , while exactly computing the latter is infeasible (we prove that solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree) , there exists an FPTAS for finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has polynomial size . These two algorithms can be combined to produce Nash equilibria that satisfy various fairness criteria.\n++++++ label:  ['strategy profile', 'nash equilibrium', 'approximation', 'exponential-time algorithm', 'approximation scheme', 'overall payoff', 'several drawback', 'social welfare', 'distributing profit', 'graphical game', 'degree-bounded graph', 'various sociallydesirable property', 'integer-payoff graphical game g']\n++++++ model: ['best response policy', 'polynomial size', 'graph', 'equilibrium', 'nash equilibria', 'nash equilibrium', 'various fairness criteria', 'graphical game', 'fair equilibrium selection', 'attractive solution concept', 'algebraic numbers', 'paper', 'problem', 'graphical games', 'social welfare']\n****  80  --->  14.285714285714286   21.05263157894737   24.999999999999996\n****  81  --->  11.11111111111111   17.391304347826086   14.285714285714288\n****  82  --->  22.22222222222222   26.086956521739133   28.571428571428577\n****  83  --->  11.11111111111111   8.695652173913043   7.142857142857144\n****  84  --->  10.526315789473681   16.666666666666664   13.793103448275861\n****  85  --->  22.22222222222222   17.391304347826086   21.42857142857143\n****  86  --->  0   0   6.666666666666667\nWe consider a permutation betting scenario , where people wager on the final ordering of n candidates: for example , the outcome of a horse race . We examine the auctioneer problem of risklessly matching up wagers or , equivalently , finding arbitrage opportunities among the proposed wagers . Requiring bidders to explicitly list the orderings that they\"d like to bet on is both unnatural and intractable , because the number of orderings is n! and the number of subsets of orderings is 2n!  . We propose two expressive betting languages that seem natural for bidders , and examine the computational complexity of the auctioneer problem in each case . Subset betting allows traders to bet either that a candidate will end up ranked among some subset of positions in the final ordering , for example , horse A will finish in positions 4 , 9 , or 13-21 , or that a position will be taken by some subset of candidates , for example horse A , B , or D will finish in position 2 . For subset betting , we show that the auctioneer problem can be solved in polynomial time if orders are divisible . Pair betting allows traders to bet on whether one candidate will end up ranked higher than another candidate , for example horse A will beat horse B .

Buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective predictions . A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events , enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk exposure , and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum . The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents\" and auctioneer\"s optimization problems . We develop and motivate the concept of a compound securities market , presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples . We then analyze in detail the auctioneer\"s matching problem . We show that , with n events , the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case .

This paper deals with a complementary problem in such settings: handling the hidden actions that are performed by the different parties . Our model is a combinatorial variant of the classical principalagent problem from economic theory . In our setting a principal must motivate a team of strategic agents to exert costly effort on his behalf , but their actions are hidden from him . Our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the efforts of the agents influence the outcome .

Their results essentially characterize learnability of degenerate classes of demand functions and therefore fall short of giving a general degree of confidence in the forecast . The present paper complements this line of research by introducing a statistical model and a measure of complexity through which we are able to study the learnability of classes of demand functions and derive a degree of confidence in the forecasts . Our results show that the class of all demand functions has unbounded complexity and therefore is not learnable , but that there exist interesting and potentially useful classes that are learnable from finite samples .

There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs , many of which - based on legal , social , or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical models . Despite this , we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks , thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms . Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature , which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B . We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B , focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A , adopt B , or - at an extra cost - adopt both A and B . We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B , and also this additional cost of adopting both , and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases , for one technology to survive the introduction of another , the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow , intermediate range .
